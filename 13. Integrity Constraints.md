# Integrity Constraints in DBMS

---

## 📌 What are Integrity Constraints?

**Integrity constraints** are rules applied to database tables to ensure that the data stored is **accurate, consistent, valid, and reliable**.

In simple words:

> Integrity constraints **protect your database from wrong or meaningless data**.

They act like **guards** that check every data entry before it is stored in the database.

---

## 🎯 Why Integrity Constraints are Important

* Prevent invalid data entry
* Maintain data accuracy
* Ensure consistency across tables
* Enforce business rules
* Improve overall data quality

---

## 🧩 Types of Integrity Constraints in DBMS

There are **five main types** of integrity constraints:

1. Domain Constraint
2. Key Constraint
3. Entity Integrity Constraint
4. Referential Integrity Constraint
5. Check Constraint

We will understand **each one with clear examples and tables**.

---

## 1️⃣ Domain Constraint

### 🔹 What is it?

A **domain constraint** restricts the **type, range, or format** of values that can be stored in a column.

It defines **what kind of values are allowed**.

---

### 🔹 Example Table: `Student`

| StudentID | Name  | Age | Gender |
| --------- | ----- | --- | ------ |
| 101       | Rahul | 20  | M      |
| 102       | Anita | 19  | F      |

### 🔹 Domain Rules:

* `Age` must be **between 18 and 60**
* `Gender` can be only **M or F**

❌ Invalid entry:

```sql
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (103, 'Aman', 15, 'X');
```

✅ Why rejected?

* Age is less than 18
* Gender is not allowed

---

## 2️⃣ Key Constraint

### 🔹 What is it?

A **key constraint** ensures that a column (or set of columns) can **uniquely identify a row** in a table.

No two rows can have the **same key value**.

---

### 🔹 Example Table: `Employee`

| EmpID | Name | Department |
| ----- | ---- | ---------- |
| E01   | Raj  | HR         |
| E02   | Neha | IT         |

Here:

* `EmpID` is a **Primary Key**

❌ Invalid entry:

```sql
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES ('E01', 'Amit', 'Finance');
```

✅ Why rejected?

* `EmpID = E01` already exists

---

## 3️⃣ Entity Integrity Constraint

### 🔹 What is it?

**Entity integrity constraint** states that:

> **Primary key cannot be NULL**

Every row must have a **unique and valid identity**.

---

### 🔹 Example Table: `Customer`

| CustomerID | Name  | City  |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- |
| C101       | Riya  | Pune  |
| C102       | Arjun | Delhi |

❌ Invalid entry:

```sql
INSERT INTO Customer VALUES (NULL, 'Karan', 'Mumbai');
```

✅ Why rejected?

* Primary key `CustomerID` cannot be NULL

---

## 4️⃣ Referential Integrity Constraint

### 🔹 What is it?

**Referential integrity** ensures that:

> A **foreign key value must match a primary key value** in another table OR be NULL.

It maintains **valid relationships between tables**.

---

### 🔹 Example Tables

#### `Department`

| DeptID | DeptName |
| ------ | -------- |
| D1     | HR       |
| D2     | IT       |

#### `Employee`

| EmpID | Name | DeptID |
| ----- | ---- | ------ |
| E01   | Ravi | D1     |
| E02   | Neha | D2     |

Here:

* `DeptID` in `Employee` is a **Foreign Key**

❌ Invalid entry:

```sql
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES ('E03', 'Aman', 'D5');
```

✅ Why rejected?

* `D5` does not exist in `Department` table

---

## 5️⃣ Check Constraint

### 🔹 What is it?

A **CHECK constraint** applies a **custom condition** that each row must satisfy.

It is used to enforce **business rules**.

---

### 🔹 Example Table: `Account`

| AccountNo | HolderName | Balance |
| --------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 1001      | Suresh     | 5000    |

### 🔹 Rule:

* Balance must be **greater than or equal to 1000**

❌ Invalid entry:

```sql
INSERT INTO Account VALUES (1002, 'Ramesh', 500);
```

✅ Why rejected?

* Balance is less than minimum required amount

| Constraint Type       | Purpose                      | Example         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| Domain                | Limits allowed values        | Age >= 18       |
| Key                   | Ensures uniqueness           | EmpID           |
| Entity Integrity      | PK cannot be NULL            | CustomerID      |
| Referential Integrity | Maintains table relationship | DeptID          |
| Check                 | Enforces conditions          | Balance >= 1000 |

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Integrity constraints **protect database quality**
* They prevent incorrect, duplicate, and inconsistent data
* Every real-world database uses **multiple constraints together**
