## 1️⃣ What is Indexing in DBMS?

**Indexing** is a technique used to **speed up data retrieval** from a database table.

👉 Think of an index like the **index page of a book**:

* You don’t read the entire book to find a topic
* You first go to the index, then jump directly to the page

📌 In DBMS:

* **Table** → Book
* **Index** → Book index
* **Row (record)** → Page

---

## 2️⃣ Why Indexing is Needed

### Problem Without Indexing

When no index exists, the database performs a **full table scan**.

Example table:

| RollNo | Name | Marks |
| ------ | ---- | ----- |
| 101    | Ayan | 78    |
| 102    | Riya | 85    |
| 103    | Neel | 90    |
| 104    | Sara | 88    |

Query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE RollNo = 104;
```

⛔ Database checks **every row one by one**.

### Problem Gets Worse When:

* Table has **millions of records**
* Query is executed **frequently**

---

### Solution: Indexing

With indexing:

* Database **does NOT scan full table**
* It directly jumps to the required record

📌 Result:

* Faster SELECT queries
* Less disk I/O
* Better performance

---

## 3️⃣ How Indexing Works (Step‑by‑Step)

Let’s understand this **slow → fast** journey.

### Step 1: Original Table (Stored on Disk)

| RollNo | Name | Marks |
| ------ | ---- | ----- |
| 101    | Ayan | 78    |
| 102    | Riya | 85    |
| 103    | Neel | 90    |
| 104    | Sara | 88    |

Stored in **random disk locations**.

---

### Step 2: Create Index on RollNo

The index stores:

* **Search key** (RollNo)
* **Pointer to record location**

Index Table:

| RollNo | Address |
| ------ | ------- |
| 101    | A1      |
| 102    | A2      |
| 103    | A3      |
| 104    | A4      |

📌 Index is:

* Smaller than main table
* Sorted

---

### Step 3: Query Execution

```sql
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE RollNo = 104;
```

Database steps:

1. Search index (fast)
2. Get address A4
3. Jump directly to record

✅ No full table scan

---

## 4️⃣ Index Structure (Basic Idea)

An index is usually implemented using:

* **B‑Tree / B+ Tree** (most common)

Basic concept:

```
Root Index
   ↓
Intermediate Index
   ↓
Leaf Nodes → Actual record pointers
```

📌 Search complexity becomes **O(log n)** instead of **O(n)**.

---

## 5️⃣ Dense Index

### Definition

A **Dense Index** has **one index entry for every record** in the table.

---

### Example Table

| RollNo | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| 101    | Ayan |
| 102    | Riya |
| 103    | Neel |

---

### Dense Index Table

| RollNo | Address |
| ------ | ------- |
| 101    | A1      |
| 102    | A2      |
| 103    | A3      |

---

### Characteristics

* One index entry per record
* Faster search
* Requires more storage

---

## 6️⃣ Sparse Index

### Definition

A **Sparse Index** has index entries for **only some records**, usually **one per data block**.

---

### Data Blocks

```
Block 1 → 101, 102
Block 2 → 103, 104
Block 3 → 105, 106
```

---

### Sparse Index Table

| RollNo | Block |
| ------ | ----- |
| 101    | B1    |
| 103    | B2    |
| 105    | B3    |

---

### Characteristics

* Less storage
* Slightly slower than dense
* Requires data to be **sorted**

---

## 7️⃣ Primary Index

### Definition

A **Primary Index** is created on the **primary key** of a table.

📌 Primary key is:

* Unique
* Sorted

---

### Example

Student Table (Primary Key = RollNo)

| RollNo | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| 101    | Ayan |
| 102    | Riya |
| 103    | Neel |

Primary Index:

| RollNo | Address |
| ------ | ------- |
| 101    | A1      |
| 102    | A2      |
| 103    | A3      |

---

### Characteristics

* Only **one primary index per table**
* Usually sparse
* Data stored in sorted order

---

## 8️⃣ Secondary Index

### Definition

A **Secondary Index** is created on a **non‑primary key** attribute.

---

### Example

| RollNo | Name | City  |
| ------ | ---- | ----- |
| 101    | Ayan | Delhi |
| 102    | Riya | Pune  |
| 103    | Neel | Delhi |

Secondary Index on City:

| City  | RollNo  |
| ----- | ------- |
| Delhi | 101,103 |
| Pune  | 102     |

---

### Characteristics

* Multiple secondary indexes allowed
* Usually dense
* Data not physically sorted

---

## 9️⃣ Clustered Index

### Definition

A **Clustered Index** determines the **physical order of data** in the table.

📌 Table can have **only one clustered index**.

---

### Example

Clustered on City:

| City  | Name |
| ----- | ---- |
| Delhi | Ayan |
| Delhi | Neel |
| Pune  | Riya |

---

### Characteristics

* Data stored in sorted order
* Faster range queries
* Only one per table

---

## 🔟 Multilevel Index

### Why Multilevel Index?

When index itself becomes **too large**, searching it becomes slow.

Solution → **Index on Index**

---

### Structure

```
Level 1 Index
     ↓
Level 2 Index
     ↓
Data Blocks
```

---

### Example

* Level 1 → Points to Level 2
* Level 2 → Points to data

📌 Reduces disk access significantly.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Comparison Tables

### Dense vs Sparse Index

| Feature | Dense        | Sparse      |
| ------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Entries | Every record | Few records |
| Storage | High         | Low         |
| Speed   | Faster       | Slower      |

---

### Primary vs Secondary Index

| Feature | Primary     | Secondary  |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Key     | Primary key | Non‑key    |
| Count   | One         | Many       |
| Order   | Sorted      | Not sorted |

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

* Faster data retrieval
* Efficient searching
* Better performance

### Disadvantages

* Extra storage
* Slower INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
* Index maintenance overhead

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Key Exam Notes & Summary

✔ Index improves **SELECT performance**
✔ Dense → fast but large
✔ Sparse → compact but slower
✔ Primary index → primary key
✔ Secondary index → non‑key
✔ Clustered index → physical order
✔ Multilevel index → index of index
