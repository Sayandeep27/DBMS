# 🔐 Role‑Based Access Control (RBAC) in DBMS

A **complete, beginner‑friendly, and professional guide** to **Role‑Based Access Control (RBAC)** in **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** — explained in **easy language**, with **clear examples, tables, and SQL snippets**, ready to **download and use on GitHub**.

---

## 📌 What is Access Control in DBMS?

**Access control** is a security mechanism that decides:

* **Who** can access the database
* **What** operations they can perform
* **On which** database objects

Without access control, **any user could read, modify, or delete sensitive data**, which is dangerous.

---

## 📌 What is Role‑Based Access Control (RBAC)?

**Role‑Based Access Control (RBAC)** is an access control model where:

> **Permissions are assigned to roles, and roles are assigned to users.**

Users **do not directly get permissions**. Instead, they inherit permissions through their roles.

---

## 🧠 Why RBAC is Needed?

Imagine a large organization with:

* Hundreds of users
* Thousands of database tables
* Frequent employee role changes

Giving permissions **user‑by‑user** becomes:

❌ Hard to manage
❌ Error‑prone
❌ Insecure

RBAC solves this by **grouping permissions into roles**.

---

## 🧩 Core Components of RBAC

RBAC is built on **three main components**.

---

### 1️⃣ Users

A **user** is any person or application that accesses the database.

Examples:

* Alice
* Bob
* HR_Application

---

### 2️⃣ Roles

A **role** represents a **job function** in an organization.

Examples:

* Admin
* Manager
* Employee
* HR

Each role contains a **set of permissions**.

---

### 3️⃣ Permissions

A **permission** defines **what action is allowed on which object**.

Examples:

* SELECT on Employee table
* INSERT on Orders table
* DELETE on Users table

---

## 🔄 How RBAC Works (Simple Flow)

```
Permissions → Roles → Users
```

1. Permissions are assigned to **roles**
2. Roles are assigned to **users**
3. Users automatically get permissions of their roles

---

## 🏢 Real‑World Example (Company Database)

### 🎯 Scenario

A company database has the following users:

* **Admin**
* **Manager**
* **Employee**

---

### 📊 Role‑Permission Mapping

| Role     | Permissions                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Admin    | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on all tables |
| Manager  | SELECT, UPDATE on Employee, Orders           |
| Employee | SELECT on own records                        |

---

### 👤 User‑Role Assignment

| User Name | Assigned Role |
| --------- | ------------- |
| Alice     | Admin         |
| Bob       | Manager       |
| Charlie   | Employee      |

---

### ✅ Result

* Alice can do **everything**
* Bob can **view and update**, but not delete
* Charlie can **only view** data

---

## 🧪 RBAC Example Using SQL

### Step 1: Create Roles

```sql
CREATE ROLE admin;
CREATE ROLE manager;
CREATE ROLE employee;
```

---

### Step 2: Grant Permissions to Roles

```sql
-- Admin permissions
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE company_db TO admin;

-- Manager permissions
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON employee TO manager;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON orders TO manager;

-- Employee permissions
GRANT SELECT ON employee TO employee;
```

---

### Step 3: Assign Roles to Users

```sql
GRANT admin TO alice;
GRANT manager TO bob;
GRANT employee TO charlie;
```

---

## 🔁 Role Hierarchy (Advanced RBAC)

RBAC supports **role inheritance**.

### Example

```
Admin
  ↓
Manager
  ↓
Employee
```

* Admin inherits Manager + Employee permissions
* Manager inherits Employee permissions

---

### SQL Example (Role Hierarchy)

```sql
GRANT employee TO manager;
GRANT manager TO admin;
```

## 🚫 RBAC vs Direct Permission Assignment

| Feature      | Direct Assignment | RBAC      |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------- |
| Management   | Difficult         | Easy      |
| Scalability  | Poor              | Excellent |
| Security     | Risky             | Strong    |
| Role Changes | Manual            | Automatic |

---

## 🔐 Advantages of RBAC

* ✔ Easy permission management
* ✔ Reduces human errors
* ✔ Improves security
* ✔ Supports large organizations
* ✔ Follows **principle of least privilege**

---

## ⚠️ Disadvantages of RBAC

* ❌ Initial role design takes time
* ❌ Too many roles can complicate management
* ❌ Not ideal for very dynamic permissions

---

## 📘 RBAC vs Other Access Control Models

| Model | Description                         |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| DAC   | Owner decides access (GRANT/REVOKE) |
| MAC   | System‑enforced strict rules        |
| RBAC  | Role‑based permissions              |

---

## 🧠 Key Exam Points (Very Important)

* RBAC assigns **permissions to roles, not users**
* Users get permissions **indirectly**
* Supports **role hierarchy**
* Improves **security and maintainability**

---

## 📌 Summary

* RBAC simplifies access control
* Best suited for **large systems**
* Widely used in **DBMS, OS, Cloud, and Enterprise apps**

---

## ✅ One‑Line Definition (Exam‑Ready)

> **Role‑Based Access Control (RBAC)** is a security model in which permissions are assigned to roles, and roles are assigned to users.
