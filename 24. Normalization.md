# 📘 Normalization in DBMS

A **complete, beginner‑friendly, and professional guide** to **Normalization in Database Management Systems (DBMS)** — explained in **simple language**, with **clear tables, examples, and SQL**, ready to **download and use on GitHub**.

---

## 📌 What is Normalization?

**Normalization** is the process of **organizing data in a database** to:

* Reduce **data redundancy** (duplicate data)
* Improve **data integrity** (accuracy & consistency)
* Eliminate **data anomalies** (insert, update, delete problems)

👉 In short: **Normalization = Clean, structured, and reliable database design**.

---

## ❓ Why Do We Need Normalization?

Without normalization, databases suffer from multiple problems.

### 🚨 Problems Without Normalization

| Problem             | Explanation                           | Example                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Redundancy** | Same data stored multiple times       | Student name repeated for every subject    |
| **Update Anomaly**  | Updating data in many places          | Change address in 10 rows                  |
| **Insert Anomaly**  | Cannot insert data without other data | Cannot add student without marks           |
| **Delete Anomaly**  | Losing important data accidentally    | Deleting last subject deletes student info |

---

## 🎯 Goals of Normalization

* Minimize duplication
* Maintain data accuracy
* Simplify database structure
* Improve performance
* Ensure logical data storage

## 📊 Example: Un‑Normalized Table (Bad Design)

### Student Table (Before Normalization)

| StudentID | StudentName | Course | Instructor | InstructorPhone |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- | --------------- |
| 101       | Rahul       | DBMS   | Amit       | 999111          |
| 101       | Rahul       | OS     | Amit       | 999111          |
| 102       | Neha        | DBMS   | Suman      | 888222          |

### ❌ Issues

* Instructor data repeated
* If Amit's phone changes → update multiple rows
* Redundant student data

---

## 🧱 Types of Normalization (Normal Forms)

1. **1NF – First Normal Form**
2. **2NF – Second Normal Form**
3. **3NF – Third Normal Form**
4. **BCNF – Boyce‑Codd Normal Form**

---

## 📌 Key Concepts Before Normalization

Understanding these terms makes **Normalization** much easier.

---

### 🔁 Data Redundancy

**Data Redundancy** means **storing the same data multiple times** in a database.

#### Example

| StudentID | StudentName | Course |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 101       | Rahul       | DBMS   |
| 101       | Rahul       | OS     |

❌ StudentName **Rahul** is repeated.

#### Problems Caused by Redundancy

* Wastes storage
* Causes inconsistency
* Makes updates difficult

---

### ✅ Data Consistency

**Data Consistency** means **same data has the same value everywhere** in the database.

#### Example of Inconsistency

| StudentID | StudentName |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 101       | Rahul       |
| 101       | RAHUL K     |

❌ Same student, different names → **Inconsistent data**

✔ Normalization helps maintain **one correct value**.

---

## ⚠️ Data Anomalies

**Anomalies** are problems that occur due to **poor database design**.

---

### ➕ Insertion Anomaly

Occurs when we **cannot insert data** without inserting unnecessary data.

#### Example

| StudentID | Name | Subject |
| --------- | ---- | ------- |

❌ Cannot add a new student until a subject is assigned.

---

### ✏️ Update Anomaly

Occurs when **same data must be updated in multiple rows**.

#### Example

| Instructor | Phone  |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Amit       | 999111 |
| Amit       | 999111 |

❌ If phone changes → update multiple rows

---

### ❌ Deletion Anomaly

Occurs when **deleting data accidentally removes important information**.

#### Example

| Student | Subject |
| ------- | ------- |
| Rahul   | DBMS    |

❌ Deleting DBMS removes **Rahul's record completely**.

---

## 🧱 Normal Forms (NF)

Normalization is achieved using **Normal Forms**, applied step by step.

---

# 🔹 First Normal Form (1NF)

### ✅ Rule

A table is in **1NF** if:

* Each column has **atomic (indivisible) values**
* No **multi‑valued attributes**
* Each record is unique

---

### ❌ Not in 1NF

| StudentID | Name | Subjects |
| --------- | ---- | -------- |
| 1         | Ravi | DBMS, OS |

---

### ✅ Converted to 1NF

| StudentID | Name | Subject |
| --------- | ---- | ------- |
| 1         | Ravi | DBMS    |
| 1         | Ravi | OS      |

✔ Values are atomic

---

# 🔹 Second Normal Form (2NF)

### ✅ Rule

A table is in **2NF** if:

* It is already in **1NF**
* **No partial dependency**

> **Partial Dependency:** Non‑key attribute depends on part of a composite key.

---

### ❌ Not in 2NF

| StudentID | Subject | StudentName |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |

🔑 Composite Key → (StudentID, Subject)

❌ StudentName depends only on StudentID

---

### ✅ Converted to 2NF

#### Student Table

| StudentID | StudentName |
| --------- | ----------- |

#### Subject Table

| StudentID | Subject |
| --------- | ------- |

✔ No partial dependency

---

# 🔹 Third Normal Form (3NF)

### ✅ Rule

A table is in **3NF** if:

* It is already in **2NF**
* **No transitive dependency**

> **Transitive Dependency:**
> A → B → C (A indirectly determines C)

---

### ❌ Not in 3NF

| EmpID | DeptID | DeptName |
| ----- | ------ | -------- |

❌ DeptName depends on DeptID, not EmpID

---

### ✅ Converted to 3NF

#### Employee Table

| EmpID | DeptID |
| ----- | ------ |

#### Department Table

| DeptID | DeptName |
| ------ | -------- |

✔ Transitive dependency removed

---

# 🔹 Boyce‑Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

### ✅ Rule

A table is in **BCNF** if:

* It is in **3NF**
* **Every determinant is a candidate key**

---

### ❌ Not in BCNF

| Course | Instructor | Room |
| ------ | ---------- | ---- |

* Course → Instructor
* Instructor → Room

❌ Instructor is not a candidate key

---

### ✅ Converted to BCNF

#### Course‑Instructor Table

| Course | Instructor |
| ------ | ---------- |

#### Instructor‑Room Table

| Instructor | Room |
| ---------- | ---- |

✔ BCNF achieved

---

## 📋 Summary Table of Normal Forms

| Normal Form | Removes                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| **1NF**     | Multi‑valued attributes |
| **2NF**     | Partial dependency      |
| **3NF**     | Transitive dependency   |
| **BCNF**    | Non‑key determinants    |

---

## ⚖️ Normalization vs Denormalization

| Normalization    | Denormalization |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Less redundancy  | More redundancy |
| Better integrity | Faster reads    |
| More tables      | Fewer tables    |
| Used in OLTP     | Used in OLAP    |

---

## 🧠 When to Stop Normalizing?

✔ Usually **3NF or BCNF** is enough

❌ Over‑normalization can:

* Increase joins
* Reduce performance

---

## 🏁 Final Takeaway

✔ Normalization is **mandatory** for clean DB design
✔ Prevents anomalies
✔ Makes database scalable & reliable
✔ Core topic for **DBMS exams & interviews**
