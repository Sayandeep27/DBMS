# 🔐 Attribute Closure (Closure Set) in DBMS

---

## 📌 What is Attribute Closure?

**Attribute Closure** (also called **Closure Set**) is a concept used in **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** to determine **all the attributes that can be functionally determined** from a given set of attributes, based on a given set of **functional dependencies (FDs)**.

In simple words:

> Attribute Closure tells us **what attributes we can find for sure** if some attributes are already known.

It is denoted as:

```
X⁺
```

Where:

* **X** → a set of attributes
* **X⁺** → closure of X (all attributes that X can determine)

---

## 🧠 Why Attribute Closure is Important?

Attribute Closure is used to:

* ✅ Check whether a set of attributes is a **Super Key** or **Candidate Key**
* ✅ Verify whether a **Functional Dependency** is valid
* ✅ Find **all attributes dependent** on a given attribute set
* ✅ Help in **Normalization** (2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
* ✅ Identify **redundancy and anomalies**

---

## 🔗 Functional Dependency (Quick Recap)

A **Functional Dependency (FD)** is written as:

```
A → B
```

Meaning:

* If two rows have the same value of **A**, they must have the same value of **B**

Example:

```
StudentID → StudentName
```

## ⚙️ How to Find Attribute Closure (Step-by-Step Algorithm)

### 🔁 Algorithm

1. Start with the given attribute set **X**
2. Initialize:

   ```
   X⁺ = X
   ```
3. For each FD **A → B**:

   * If **A ⊆ X⁺**, then add **B** to **X⁺**
4. Repeat step 3 until **no new attributes** can be added
5. The final set is **X⁺ (Attribute Closure)**

---

## 📊 Example 1: Basic Attribute Closure

### Given Relation

```
R(A, B, C, D)
```

### Functional Dependencies

| FD No | Functional Dependency |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| 1     | A → B                 |
| 2     | B → C                 |
| 3     | C → D                 |

### Find Closure of `{A}`

#### Step-by-Step Calculation

```
A⁺ = {A}
```

* A → B ⇒ add B

```
A⁺ = {A, B}
```

* B → C ⇒ add C

```
A⁺ = {A, B, C}
```

* C → D ⇒ add D

```
A⁺ = {A, B, C, D}
```

### ✅ Final Answer

```
A⁺ = {A, B, C, D}
```

### 🔑 Conclusion

Since **A⁺ contains all attributes of R**, **A is a Candidate Key**.

---

## 📊 Example 2: Partial Closure

### Given Relation

```
R(A, B, C, D)
```

### Functional Dependencies

| FD No | Functional Dependency |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| 1     | A → B                 |
| 2     | B → C                 |

### Find Closure of `{B}`

```
B⁺ = {B}
```

* B → C ⇒ add C

```
B⁺ = {B, C}
```

### ❌ Final Answer

```
B⁺ = {B, C}
```

### Conclusion

* B⁺ does **NOT** contain all attributes
* ❌ B is **NOT a key**

---

## 📊 Example 3: Composite Attribute Closure

### Given Relation

```
R(A, B, C, D, E)
```

### Functional Dependencies

| FD No | Functional Dependency |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| 1     | A → B                 |
| 2     | B → C                 |
| 3     | CD → E                |

### Find Closure of `{A, D}`

```
(AD)⁺ = {A, D}
```

* A → B ⇒ add B

```
(AD)⁺ = {A, B, D}
```

* B → C ⇒ add C

```
(AD)⁺ = {A, B, C, D}
```

* CD → E ⇒ add E

```
(AD)⁺ = {A, B, C, D, E}
```

### ✅ Final Answer

```
(AD)⁺ = {A, B, C, D, E}
```

### 🔑 Conclusion

`{A, D}` is a **Candidate Key**

## 🗝️ How Attribute Closure Helps Identify Keys

| Condition                                     | Meaning                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| X⁺ contains all attributes                    | X is a **Super Key**     |
| X⁺ contains all attributes and no subset does | X is a **Candidate Key** |
| X⁺ does not contain all attributes            | X is **not a key**       |

---

## 🧪 Example 4: Checking Functional Dependency using Closure

### Given

```
FD: AB → C
```

### Check Validity

1. Compute `(AB)⁺`
2. If `(AB)⁺` contains `C`
3. Then FD is **valid**

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

* ❌ Forgetting to **repeat FD checks** until no change occurs
* ❌ Assuming closure in one pass only
* ❌ Missing **composite dependencies** (like AB → C)
* ❌ Forgetting that closure starts with the **original attributes**

---

## 🧠 Quick Revision Summary

* **Attribute Closure** finds all attributes functionally determined by a given set
* Written as **X⁺**
* Used to identify **keys, super keys, and FD validation**
* Computed using **iterative FD application**

## 📌 Final One-Line Definition

> **Attribute Closure** is the complete set of attributes that can be functionally determined from a given attribute set using functional dependencies.
