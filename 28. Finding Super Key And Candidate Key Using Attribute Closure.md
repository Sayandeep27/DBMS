## 1️⃣ What is a Key in DBMS?

A **key** is a set of one or more attributes that can **uniquely identify a record (row)** in a table.

Example table:

| RollNo | Name  | Email                             | Course |
| ------ | ----- | --------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1      | Rahul | [r@gmail.com](mailto:r@gmail.com) | DBMS   |
| 2      | Anita | [a@gmail.com](mailto:a@gmail.com) | OS     |

Here, **RollNo** and **Email** can uniquely identify a student → they are keys.

---

## 2️⃣ What is a Super Key?

A **Super Key** is **any set of attributes** that can uniquely identify a row.

📌 Important:

* It **may contain extra attributes**
* Every candidate key is a super key

Example:

* {RollNo}
* {RollNo, Name}
* {Email}

All are **Super Keys**.

---

## 3️⃣ What is a Candidate Key?

A **Candidate Key** is a **minimal super key**.

📌 Minimal means:

* No extra attribute
* Removing any attribute will break uniqueness

Example:

* {RollNo} ✅
* {Email} ✅
* {RollNo, Name} ❌ (Name is extra)

---

## 4️⃣ What is Attribute Closure?

**Attribute Closure** of a set of attributes (X⁺) is the **set of all attributes that X can determine** using given functional dependencies.

📌 Used to:

* Check if a set of attributes is a **super key**
* Find **candidate keys**

Notation:

```
X⁺ = all attributes that can be derived from X
```

---

## 5️⃣ Why Do We Use Attribute Closure?

We use attribute closure to answer:

✔ Can this attribute set identify all attributes?
✔ Is this a super key?
✔ Is this a candidate key?

Rule:

> If **X⁺ contains all attributes of the relation**, then X is a **Super Key**

---

## 6️⃣ Steps to Find Super Keys Using Attribute Closure

### Step-by-step algorithm:

1. Start with a set of attributes X
2. Add all attributes from X into X⁺
3. Apply functional dependencies repeatedly
4. Stop when no new attribute can be added
5. If X⁺ = all attributes → X is a **Super Key**

---

## 7️⃣ Steps to Find Candidate Keys

1. Find all **super keys** using attribute closure
2. Remove extra attributes
3. Keep only **minimal super keys**
4. These minimal keys are **candidate keys**

---

## 8️⃣ Complete Worked Example (Very Important)

### Given:

Relation:

```
R(A, B, C, D)
```

Functional Dependencies:

```
A → B
B → C
C → D
```

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Find A⁺ (Attribute Closure of A)

Start:

```
A⁺ = {A}
```

Apply dependencies:

* A → B → add B
* B → C → add C
* C → D → add D

Final:

```
A⁺ = {A, B, C, D}
```

✅ Contains all attributes → **A is a Super Key**

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Check if A is a Candidate Key

Try removing attributes:

* A alone already works
* No extra attribute present

✅ **A is a Candidate Key**

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Check Other Attribute Sets

#### Check B⁺:

```
B⁺ = {B, C, D}
```

❌ Missing A → Not a super key

#### Check C⁺:

```
C⁺ = {C, D}
```

❌ Not a super key

#### Check AB⁺:

```
AB⁺ = {A, B, C, D}
```

✅ Super key ❌ Not minimal

---

### 🔑 Final Result

✔ **Super Keys**:

* {A}
* {A, B}
* {A, C}
* {A, D}
* {A, B, C}

✔ **Candidate Key**:

* {A}

## 9️⃣ Super Key vs Candidate Key (Quick Table)

| Feature                  | Super Key | Candidate Key |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------------- |
| Uniqueness               | Yes       | Yes           |
| Minimal                  | No        | Yes           |
| Extra attributes allowed | Yes       | No            |
| Number                   | Many      | Few           |

---

## 🔟 Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Forgetting to apply dependencies repeatedly
❌ Not checking minimality for candidate keys
❌ Assuming all super keys are candidate keys
❌ Stopping closure too early

---

## ✅ Key Takeaway

* **Attribute Closure** is the backbone of key identification
* If X⁺ = all attributes → X is a **Super Key**
* If X is minimal → it is a **Candidate Key**
