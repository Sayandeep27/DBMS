# Denormalisation in DBMS

---

## 📌 What is Denormalisation?

**Denormalisation** is the process of **intentionally adding redundancy** (duplicate data) into a database that has already been **normalized**.

In simple words:

* **Normalization** → Reduce redundancy, improve consistency
* **Denormalisation** → Add redundancy, improve performance

Denormalisation is mainly used to **speed up data retrieval** by reducing the number of joins required in queries.

## 🔁 Normalization vs Denormalisation

| Aspect           | Normalization     | Denormalisation          |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Goal             | Remove redundancy | Improve read performance |
| Data Duplication | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes                    |
| Number of Tables | More              | Fewer                    |
| Joins Required   | Many              | Few or none              |
| Data Consistency | High              | Needs extra care         |
| Use Case         | OLTP systems      | OLAP / reporting systems |

## 🧠 Why Do We Need Denormalisation?

In highly normalized databases:

* Queries may require **multiple joins**
* Performance becomes slow for **read-heavy operations**
* Reporting and analytics queries become complex

Denormalisation helps by:

* Reducing joins
* Storing frequently accessed data together
* Improving query response time

## 🏗️ Example: Normalized Database (Before Denormalisation)

### 📘 Student Table

| Student_ID | Student_Name | Dept_ID |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------- |
| 1          | Rahul        | D01     |
| 2          | Anita        | D02     |

### 📗 Department Table

| Dept_ID | Dept_Name        |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| D01     | Computer Science |
| D02     | Mechanical       |

### 🔍 Query to Get Student with Department Name

```sql
SELECT s.Student_Name, d.Dept_Name
FROM Student s
JOIN Department d
ON s.Dept_ID = d.Dept_ID;
```

➡️ Requires a **JOIN**, which can be costly for large datasets.

## 🧩 Denormalised Database (After Denormalisation)

### 📕 Student Table (Denormalised)

| Student_ID | Student_Name | Dept_ID | Dept_Name        |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------- | ---------------- |
| 1          | Rahul        | D01     | Computer Science |
| 2          | Anita        | D02     | Mechanical       |

### 🔍 Query After Denormalisation

```sql
SELECT Student_Name, Dept_Name
FROM Student;
```

✅ **No JOIN required** → Faster query execution

---

## 🛠️ Common Denormalisation Techniques

---

### 1️⃣ Adding Redundant Columns

Storing derived or repeated data in the same table.

**Example:**

* Store `Dept_Name` inside `Student` table

---

### 2️⃣ Merging Tables

Combine multiple related tables into one.

**Example:**

* Merge `Order` and `Customer` tables

---

### 3️⃣ Storing Derived Data

Store calculated values instead of computing them every time.

**Example:**

```text
Total_Price = Quantity × Price
```

---

### 4️⃣ Repeating Groups

Allow controlled repetition of attributes.

**Example:**

* Multiple phone numbers stored in one row

---

## 📊 Real-World Example: E-commerce System

### Normalized Structure

* Customer Table
* Order Table
* Product Table

Each order query requires multiple joins.

### Denormalised Structure

| Order_ID | Customer_Name | Product_Name | Price | Quantity |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----- | -------- |

✔ Faster reporting
✔ Easier analytics

---

## ✅ Advantages of Denormalisation

* 🚀 Faster data retrieval
* 📉 Fewer joins required
* 📊 Better performance for reporting queries
* 🧠 Simplified query logic
* ⚡ Ideal for read-heavy systems

---

## ❌ Disadvantages of Denormalisation

* 🔁 Data redundancy
* ⚠ Risk of data inconsistency
* ✍ Slower write operations
* 🔧 More complex updates
* 📦 Increased storage usage

---

## ⚖️ When to Use Denormalisation?

✔ Use when:

* Database is **read-heavy**
* Performance is more important than storage
* Used for **analytics / reporting**

❌ Avoid when:

* Database is **write-heavy**
* Strong consistency is required
* Frequent updates happen

---

## 🧪 Normalisation + Denormalisation Strategy

Best practice is:

```text
Normalize first → Measure performance → Denormalise selectively
```

Never denormalise blindly.

## 🧠 Summary

| Feature          | Denormalisation     |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Purpose          | Improve performance |
| Data Duplication | Yes                 |
| Query Speed      | High                |
| Data Consistency | Needs management    |

## 📌 Final Note

Denormalisation is **not bad design** — it is a **performance optimization technique** used wisely after proper normalization.
