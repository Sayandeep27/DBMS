# 📘 Minimal Cover of Functional Dependencies (DBMS)

---

## 📌 Introduction

In **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**, **Functional Dependencies (FDs)** are used to describe relationships between attributes in a relation.

When designing a database (especially during **normalization**), we often need a **simplified and optimized set of functional dependencies** that conveys the same information as the original set. This simplified version is called the **Minimal Cover** (also known as **Canonical Cover**).

---

## 🔍 What is a Minimal Cover?

A **Minimal Cover** of a set of functional dependencies is the **smallest equivalent set of FDs** that:

1. Has **no unnecessary attributes** on the left-hand side
2. Has **only one attribute** on the right-hand side
3. Contains **no redundant functional dependencies**

> ✔️ The minimal cover preserves **exactly the same closure** as the original set of functional dependencies.

## 🎯 Why Do We Need a Minimal Cover?

| Reason             | Explanation                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simplification     | Reduces complexity of functional dependencies                  |
| Normalization      | Essential for finding candidate keys and decomposing relations |
| Redundancy Removal | Eliminates unnecessary dependencies                            |
| Efficient Design   | Makes database design clean and optimized                      |

## 🧩 Conditions for a Minimal Cover

A set of functional dependencies **F** is a **minimal cover** if and only if:

1. **Right-hand side has a single attribute**
   Example:
   ❌ `A → BC`
   ✅ `A → B` and `A → C`

2. **No extraneous attribute in the left-hand side**
   Example:
   ❌ `AB → C` (if `A → C` already holds)
   ✅ `A → C`

3. **No redundant functional dependency**
   Removing any FD should change the closure of the set

---

## 🛠️ Steps to Find Minimal Cover (Algorithm)

### ✅ Step 1: Split RHS Attributes

Convert each functional dependency so that **only one attribute appears on the right-hand side**.

**Example:**
`A → BC`
⬇️
`A → B`
`A → C`

---

### ✅ Step 2: Remove Extraneous Attributes from LHS

Check each attribute on the **left-hand side** of every FD.

An attribute is **extraneous** if removing it **does not change the closure**.

**Test:**
For `AB → C`, check if:

* `A → C` is implied by the remaining FDs

If yes, then `B` is extraneous.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Remove Redundant Functional Dependencies

Check each FD to see if it can be **removed without changing the closure**.

If removing an FD does not affect the result, it is **redundant**.

---

## 📊 Complete Worked Example

### 🔹 Given Functional Dependencies

```
F = { A → BC, B → D, AB → C, C → A }
```

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Split RHS

```
A → B
A → C
B → D
AB → C
C → A
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Remove Extraneous Attributes

Check `AB → C`:

* Since `A → C` already exists
* Attribute `B` is extraneous

So remove `AB → C`

Remaining set:

```
A → B
A → C
B → D
C → A
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Remove Redundant FDs

Check each FD:

* `A → C` ❌ NOT redundant (cannot be derived without it)
* `A → B` ❌ NOT redundant
* `B → D` ❌ NOT redundant
* `C → A` ❌ NOT redundant

---

### ✅ Final Minimal Cover

```
{ A → B, A → C, B → D, C → A }
```

## 📌 Key Points to Remember

* Minimal cover is **not unique** (different orders may produce different but equivalent covers)
* Always preserve **functional dependency closure**
* Used heavily in:

  * Normalization (2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
  * Candidate key computation
  * Schema decomposition

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake                          | Explanation                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Skipping RHS split               | Every FD must have a single RHS attribute |
| Removing needed attributes       | Always verify closure before removal      |
| Assuming minimal cover is unique | Multiple minimal covers may exist         |
