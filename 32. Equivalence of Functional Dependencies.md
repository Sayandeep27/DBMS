# Equivalence of Functional Dependencies (FDs)

A **professional, exam‑ready and GitHub‑ready guide** to understand **Equivalence of Functional Dependencies** in **DBMS**, explained in **simple language with clear examples**.

---

## 📌 What is a Functional Dependency?

In a relation (table), a **functional dependency** is written as:

```
X → Y
```

It means:

> If two rows have the **same value of X**, they must have the **same value of Y**.

### Example

| RollNo | Name  | Dept |
| ------ | ----- | ---- |
| 101    | Rahul | CSE  |
| 102    | Anita | ECE  |

Here:

```
RollNo → Name, Dept
```

## 📌 What Does Equivalence of Functional Dependencies Mean?

Two sets of functional dependencies are said to be **equivalent** if **they imply each other**.

### ✅ Definition

Let:

* **F** = Set of functional dependencies
* **G** = Another set of functional dependencies

Then:

```
F ≡ G  ⇔  F⁺ = G⁺
```

Where:

* **F⁺** = Closure of F (all dependencies that can be derived from F)
* **G⁺** = Closure of G

👉 If both closures are the same, the FD sets are **equivalent**.

---

## 📌 Key Rule for Equivalence

Two FD sets **F and G are equivalent if and only if**:

```
F ⊨ G   AND   G ⊨ F
```

Meaning:

* Every FD in **G** can be derived from **F**
* Every FD in **F** can be derived from **G**

---

## 📌 How to Check Equivalence of Functional Dependencies?

### 🔹 Step‑by‑Step Process

1. Take one FD set (say **F**)
2. Find **closure of left‑hand attributes** of each FD in **G** using **F**
3. Check if all FDs of **G** are satisfied
4. Repeat steps by swapping **F** and **G**

If both directions are true → FD sets are equivalent

---

## 📌 Example 1: Simple Equivalence

### Given

**F:**

```
A → B
B → C
```

**G:**

```
A → C
B → C
A → B
```

---

### Step 1: Check if F ⊨ G

From **F**:

* A → B
* B → C

Using transitivity:

```
A → C
```

So all dependencies in **G** can be derived from **F**.

✅ F ⊨ G

---

### Step 2: Check if G ⊨ F

From **G**:

* A → B (already present)
* B → C (already present)

So all dependencies in **F** can be derived from **G**.

✅ G ⊨ F

---

### ✔ Conclusion

```
F ≡ G
```

They are **equivalent FD sets**.

---

## 📌 Example 2: Non‑Equivalent FD Sets

### Given

**F:**

```
A → B
```

**G:**

```
B → A
```

---

### Check F ⊨ G

From A → B, we **cannot** derive B → A.

❌ F ⊭ G

---

### Conclusion

```
F ≠ G
```

They are **NOT equivalent**.

---

## 📌 Example 3: Using Attribute Closure

### Given Relation R(A, B, C)

**F:**

```
A → B
AB → C
```

**G:**

```
A → B
A → C
```

---

### Step 1: Compute A⁺ using F

Start with:

```
A⁺ = {A}
```

Apply A → B:

```
A⁺ = {A, B}
```

Apply AB → C:

```
A⁺ = {A, B, C}
```

So:

```
A → C  (derived)
```

✅ F ⊨ G

---

### Step 2: Check G ⊨ F

From G:

* A → B
* A → C

But we **cannot derive AB → C** explicitly.

❌ G ⊭ F

---

### ✔ Conclusion

```
F ≠ G
```

## 📌 Armstrong’s Axioms (Used for Equivalence)

| Axiom        | Rule                          | Example              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Reflexivity  | If Y ⊆ X then X → Y           | AB → A               |
| Augmentation | If X → Y then XZ → YZ         | A → B ⇒ AC → BC      |
| Transitivity | If X → Y and Y → Z then X → Z | A → B, B → C ⇒ A → C |

These axioms are used to **prove equivalence**.

---

## 📌 Why Equivalence of FDs is Important?

✔ Used in **database normalization**
✔ Helps find **minimal cover**
✔ Ensures **same constraints** in different FD representations
✔ Prevents **redundant dependencies**
✔ Important for **BCNF and 3NF decomposition**

## 📌 Equivalence vs Minimal Cover

| Concept       | Meaning                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Equivalence   | Two FD sets represent the same constraints |
| Minimal Cover | Smallest equivalent FD set                 |
