# 📘 Views in DBMS – Easy & Complete Explanation

---

## 📌 What is a View in DBMS?

A **View** in a Database Management System (DBMS) is a **virtual table** created using a SQL query.

* It **does not store data physically**.
* It shows data that already exists in one or more base tables.
* It behaves **like a table** when you query it.

👉 Think of a **view as a saved SQL query** with a name.

---

## 🧠 Simple Real-Life Analogy

Imagine a **college database**:

* The full database has **all student details** (marks, address, phone, fees, etc.).
* A **teacher** only needs **Roll No, Name, Marks**.

Instead of giving access to the full table, we create a **VIEW** that shows only required columns.

✔️ Safe
✔️ Simple
✔️ Controlled access

---

## 🏗️ Why Do We Need Views?

Views are used to:

* 🔒 **Improve security** (hide sensitive columns)
* 🧩 **Simplify complex queries**
* 🔁 **Reuse queries**
* 👀 **Present customized data** to different users
* 🧹 **Maintain consistency** in data access

## 📄 Base Table vs View

| Feature                 | Base Table   | View        |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Stores data physically  | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No        |
| Created using           | CREATE TABLE | CREATE VIEW |
| Can contain constraints | ✅ Yes        | ❌ Limited   |
| Takes storage           | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No        |
| Can be queried          | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes       |

## 🧾 Basic Syntax of View

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

---

## 🧪 Example 1: Simple View

### Base Table: `employees`

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(30),
    salary INT
);
```

### Insert Data

```sql
INSERT INTO employees VALUES
(1, 'Rahul', 'HR', 40000),
(2, 'Anita', 'IT', 60000),
(3, 'Karan', 'IT', 55000);
```

### Create a View

```sql
CREATE VIEW it_employees AS
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT';
```

### Use the View

```sql
SELECT * FROM it_employees;
```

✅ Output:

| emp_id | emp_name | salary |
| ------ | -------- | ------ |
| 2      | Anita    | 60000  |
| 3      | Karan    | 55000  |

---

## 🔍 Important Point

Even though `it_employees` looks like a table:

* Data is actually coming from **employees** table
* If employees table changes → view updates automatically

---

## 🔐 Views for Security

### Hide Salary Column

```sql
CREATE VIEW public_employees AS
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, department
FROM employees;
```

✔️ Users cannot see salary
✔️ Base table remains safe

---

## 🔄 Updating Data Using Views

### Can We INSERT / UPDATE Using Views?

👉 **Yes, but with conditions**

### Allowed When:

* View is based on **single table**
* No GROUP BY
* No DISTINCT
* No aggregate functions

### Example

```sql
UPDATE it_employees
SET salary = 65000
WHERE emp_name = 'Anita';
```

✔️ Updates salary in **employees** table

---

## ❌ When Views Are NOT Updatable

Views become **read-only** if they use:

* JOIN
* GROUP BY
* HAVING
* DISTINCT
* Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

---

## 🧮 Example 2: View with Aggregation (Read Only)

```sql
CREATE VIEW dept_salary AS
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

❌ Cannot INSERT or UPDATE this view

---

## 🔗 Views with JOIN

```sql
CREATE VIEW emp_dept_view AS
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d
ON e.department = d.dept_id;
```

✔️ Useful for reporting
❌ Not updatable

---

## 🧨 Types of Views

### 1️⃣ Simple View

* Based on one table
* No functions
* Usually updatable

### 2️⃣ Complex View

* Multiple tables
* Aggregations
* Read-only

### 3️⃣ Materialized View *(Advanced)*

* Stores result physically
* Faster access
* Needs refresh

---

## ⚙️ Drop a View

```sql
DROP VIEW it_employees;
```

⚠️ Does NOT affect base table

---

## 🧪 Check Existing Views

```sql
SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'VIEW';
```

---

## 📊 View vs Materialized View

| Feature       | View   | Materialized View |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| Stores data   | ❌ No   | ✅ Yes             |
| Speed         | Normal | Fast              |
| Needs refresh | ❌ No   | ✅ Yes             |
| Storage       | ❌ No   | ✅ Yes             |

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* A **View is a virtual table**
* It simplifies queries and improves security
* Data is always fetched from base tables
* Some views are **read-only**
* Views are heavily used in **real-world databases**

✔️ Data security
✔️ Simplifying complex SQL
✔️ Reusability
✔️ Multi-user environments
