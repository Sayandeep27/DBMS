# 📘 Isolation in DBMS – Complete Beginner to Exam‑Ready Guide

A **clear, simple, and professional explanation** of **Isolation**, **Isolation Levels**, and **Isolation Anomalies** in **DBMS**.

This README is:

* Beginner‑friendly
* Exam‑oriented
* Interview‑ready
* GitHub‑ready

---

## 🔹 What is Isolation in DBMS?

**Isolation** is one of the **ACID properties** of a transaction.

> **Isolation ensures that multiple transactions running at the same time do NOT interfere with each other.**

Each transaction should behave **as if it is the only transaction in the system**, even though many transactions may be executing concurrently.

---

## 🔹 Why Do We Need Isolation?

Without isolation:

* Data may become **inconsistent**
* Users may see **temporary or wrong data**
* Final database state may be **incorrect**

Isolation prevents problems called **concurrency anomalies**.

---

## 🔹 Real‑Life Example (Simple)

Imagine:

* **Transaction T1** is updating a bank account balance
* **Transaction T2** is reading the same balance at the same time

If isolation is weak, T2 may read **half‑updated data**, which is dangerous.

---

## 🔹 Concurrency Anomalies (Isolation Violations)

When isolation is not properly maintained, the following problems occur:

1. Dirty Read
2. Non‑Repeatable Read
3. Phantom Read

Let’s understand **each one clearly**.

---

## 🚫 1. Dirty Read

### 📌 What is Dirty Read?

A **dirty read** happens when:

* One transaction reads **uncommitted data** of another transaction

If the other transaction **rolls back**, the read data becomes invalid.

---

### 🧠 Example

**Initial Table: Account**

| AccountID | Balance |
| --------- | ------- |
| 101       | 1000    |

---

**Transaction T1** (Not committed yet)

```sql
UPDATE Account SET Balance = 2000 WHERE AccountID = 101;
```

**Transaction T2** (Reads before commit)

```sql
SELECT Balance FROM Account WHERE AccountID = 101;
-- Reads 2000 (DIRTY DATA)
```

Now if **T1 ROLLBACKS**, actual balance becomes **1000**, but T2 already read **wrong data**.

👉 This is a **Dirty Read**.

---

## 🚫 2. Non‑Repeatable Read

### 📌 What is Non‑Repeatable Read?

A **non‑repeatable read** occurs when:

* A transaction reads the **same row twice**
* Gets **different values** each time

This happens because another transaction **updates and commits** between the two reads.

---

### 🧠 Example

**Initial Table: Product**

| ProductID | Price |
| --------- | ----- |
| P1        | 500   |

---

**Transaction T1**

```sql
SELECT Price FROM Product WHERE ProductID = 'P1';
-- Price = 500
```

**Transaction T2**

```sql
UPDATE Product SET Price = 600 WHERE ProductID = 'P1';
COMMIT;
```

**Transaction T1 (again)**

```sql
SELECT Price FROM Product WHERE ProductID = 'P1';
-- Price = 600
```

👉 Same query, different result → **Non‑Repeatable Read**.

---

## 🚫 3. Phantom Read

### 📌 What is Phantom Read?

A **phantom read** occurs when:

* A transaction executes the **same query twice**
* Gets **different number of rows**

This happens due to **INSERT or DELETE** by another transaction.

---

### 🧠 Example

**Initial Table: Orders**

| OrderID | Amount |
| ------- | ------ |
| 1       | 5000   |
| 2       | 7000   |

---

**Transaction T1**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Amount > 6000;
-- Returns 1 row (OrderID = 2)
```

**Transaction T2**

```sql
INSERT INTO Orders VALUES (3, 8000);
COMMIT;
```

**Transaction T1 (again)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Amount > 6000;
-- Returns 2 rows (2, 3)
```

👉 Extra row appears → **Phantom Read**.

---

## 🔹 Isolation Levels in DBMS

DBMS provides **four isolation levels** to control concurrency.

From **weakest** to **strongest**:

1. Read Uncommitted
2. Read Committed
3. Repeatable Read
4. Serializable

---

## 🔐 1. Read Uncommitted

### 📌 Meaning

* Lowest isolation level
* Transactions can read **uncommitted data**

---

### 🚫 Problems Allowed

| Problem             | Allowed |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| Dirty Read          | ✅ Yes   |
| Non‑Repeatable Read | ✅ Yes   |
| Phantom Read        | ✅ Yes   |

---

### 🧠 Key Point

👉 Fastest but **unsafe**
👉 Rarely used in real systems

---

## 🔐 2. Read Committed

### 📌 Meaning

* A transaction can read **only committed data**

---

### 🚫 Problems Allowed

| Problem             | Allowed |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| Dirty Read          | ❌ No    |
| Non‑Repeatable Read | ✅ Yes   |
| Phantom Read        | ✅ Yes   |

---

### 🧠 Key Point

👉 Most **commonly used** isolation level
👉 Prevents dirty reads only

---

## 🔐 3. Repeatable Read

### 📌 Meaning

* Rows read by a transaction **cannot be changed** by others until it finishes

---

### 🚫 Problems Allowed

| Problem             | Allowed |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| Dirty Read          | ❌ No    |
| Non‑Repeatable Read | ❌ No    |
| Phantom Read        | ✅ Yes   |

---

### 🧠 Key Point

👉 Same row always gives same value
👉 New rows may still appear

---

## 🔐 4. Serializable

### 📌 Meaning

* Highest isolation level
* Transactions behave as if executed **one after another**

---

### 🚫 Problems Allowed

| Problem             | Allowed |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| Dirty Read          | ❌ No    |
| Non‑Repeatable Read | ❌ No    |
| Phantom Read        | ❌ No    |

---

### 🧠 Key Point

👉 Safest but **slowest**
👉 Best for **critical systems**

---

## 🔹 Isolation Levels vs Anomalies (Summary Table)

| Isolation Level  | Dirty Read | Non‑Repeatable Read | Phantom Read |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Read Uncommitted | ✅          | ✅                   | ✅            |
| Read Committed   | ❌          | ✅                   | ✅            |
| Repeatable Read  | ❌          | ❌                   | ✅            |
| Serializable     | ❌          | ❌                   | ❌            |

---

## 🎯 Exam‑Friendly One‑Line Summary

* **Dirty Read** → Reading uncommitted data
* **Non‑Repeatable Read** → Same row, different value
* **Phantom Read** → Same query, different rows
* **Serializable** → No anomalies at all

---

## ✅ Final Takeaway

Isolation is about **how safe your data reads are** when multiple transactions run together.

Higher isolation =

* More safety
* Less concurrency

Lower isolation =

* Faster execution
* More risk
