# 🔒 Isolation in DBMS (Explained Simply)

Isolation is one of the **ACID properties** of a database transaction.

---

## 👉 In Simple Words

**Isolation** means that multiple transactions running at the same time should **NOT disturb each other**.

Each transaction should behave **as if it is running alone**, even when many transactions are running together.

---

## ❓ Why Isolation Is Needed

In real databases:

* Many users access data at the same time
* Transactions run concurrently
* Without isolation, data can become **incorrect or inconsistent**

Isolation ensures:

* Partial or intermediate changes of one transaction are **not visible** to others
* The database remains **correct and reliable**

---

## 🏧 Easy Real-Life Example (ATM)

You have **₹10,000** in your bank account.

Two transactions start at the same time:

* **T1**: Withdraw ₹4,000
* **T2**: Withdraw ₹3,000

### What Isolation Ensures

Both transactions should see the correct balance and execute safely.

### Without Isolation

* Both read ₹10,000
* Both succeed
* Final balance becomes **wrong**

### With Isolation

* One transaction completes first
* The other sees the updated balance
* Final balance = **₹3,000 (correct)**

---

## 🗄️ Technical Example (Database Table)

### Initial Table: Account

| AccountID | Balance |
| --------- | ------- |
| 101       | 10000   |

---

### Two Concurrent Transactions

#### Transaction T1

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE Account SET Balance = Balance - 4000 WHERE AccountID = 101;
-- Not committed yet
```

#### Transaction T2

```sql
BEGIN;
SELECT Balance FROM Account WHERE AccountID = 101;
```

### With Isolation

* T2 **cannot see** T1’s uncommitted change
* T2 either:

  * Waits, or
  * Reads old committed data

---

## ⚠️ Problems Isolation Prevents (Very Important)

Without proper isolation, the following problems occur:

---

### 1️⃣ Dirty Read

**Definition**: Reading uncommitted data from another transaction

#### Example

* T1 updates balance but doesn’t commit
* T2 reads the new balance
* T1 rolls back

❌ T2 used **wrong data**

---

### 2️⃣ Non-Repeatable Read

**Definition**: Same query gives different results in the same transaction

#### Example

* T1 reads balance = 10,000
* T2 updates and commits
* T1 reads again → balance = 6,000

❌ Data changed unexpectedly

---

### 3️⃣ Phantom Read

**Definition**: New rows appear between two reads

#### Example

* T1 counts employees in Dept A → 5
* T2 inserts new employee and commits
* T1 counts again → 6

❌ “Phantom” row appeared

---

## 📊 Isolation Levels (Quick Overview)

Isolation is implemented using **Isolation Levels**:

| Isolation Level  | Prevents                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Read Uncommitted | Nothing                     |
| Read Committed   | Dirty Read                  |
| Repeatable Read  | Dirty + Non-Repeatable Read |
| Serializable     | All problems                |

> **Serializable** is the highest isolation and safest.

---

## 🧠 One-Line Summary

Isolation ensures that even when many transactions run at the same time, **each transaction works independently without interfering with others**, keeping the database consistent.

---

# 🔐 Isolation Levels in DBMS (Explained Clearly)

## First, Recall What Isolation Means

Isolation ensures that:

* Multiple transactions running at the same time **do not interfere** with each other.

Isolation is controlled using **Isolation Levels**.

---

## ❓ Why Isolation Levels Exist

* Full isolation (one transaction at a time) is very safe
* But it is also **slow**

Databases allow different levels of isolation to balance:

* Consistency
* Performance

So we choose **how much interference is allowed**.

---

## 📈 The 4 Isolation Levels (Weakest → Strongest)

1. Read Uncommitted
2. Read Committed
3. Repeatable Read
4. Serializable

We will understand each one using the **same table** and **same transactions**.

---

## 🗄️ Common Example Table

### Account Table (Initial State)

| AccountID | Balance |
| --------- | ------- |
| 101       | 10000   |

---

### Transactions Used in All Examples

#### Transaction T1 (Withdraw ₹4000)

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE Account SET Balance = Balance - 4000 WHERE AccountID = 101;
-- commit later
```

#### Transaction T2 (Read Balance)

```sql
BEGIN;
SELECT Balance FROM Account WHERE AccountID = 101;
```

---

## 1️⃣ Read Uncommitted (Lowest Isolation)

### Rule

A transaction **CAN read uncommitted data** of another transaction

### What It Allows

* ❌ Dirty Read
* ❌ Non-repeatable Read
* ❌ Phantom Read

### Step-by-Step Example (Dirty Read)

* T1 updates balance to 6000 (not committed)
* T2 reads balance → 6000
* T1 rolls back ❌
* Actual balance becomes 10000

👉 T2 read **wrong data**

### Result

* Fastest
* Unsafe
* Rarely used

### Summary

**Read Uncommitted** = “I don’t care, just show me anything”

---

## 2️⃣ Read Committed (Most Common)

### Rule

A transaction can read **only committed data**

### What It Prevents

* ✅ Dirty Read

### What It Allows

* ❌ Non-repeatable Read
* ❌ Phantom Read

### Step-by-Step Example

* T1 updates balance to 6000 (not committed)
* T2 tries to read balance
* T2 waits
* T1 commits
* T2 reads balance → 6000

✔ No dirty read

### Non-Repeatable Read Happens

* T2 reads balance → 10000
* T1 updates balance to 6000 and commits
* T2 reads again → 6000

❌ Same query, different result

### Summary

**Read Committed** = “Show me only confirmed data”

---

## 3️⃣ Repeatable Read (Stronger Isolation)

### Rule

Rows read once **cannot change** during the transaction

### What It Prevents

* ✅ Dirty Read
* ✅ Non-repeatable Read

### What It Allows

* ❌ Phantom Read

### Step-by-Step Example

* T2 reads balance → 10000
* T1 tries to update same row
* T1 waits
* T2 reads again → 10000
* T2 commits
* T1 executes update

✔ Same value every time

### Phantom Read Example

**Employee Table**

| EmpID | Dept |
| ----- | ---- |
| 1     | IT   |
| 2     | IT   |

**T1**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employee WHERE Dept='IT';
-- result = 2
```

**T2**

```sql
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (3, 'IT');
COMMIT;
```

**T1 Again**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employee WHERE Dept='IT';
-- result = 3
```

❌ New row appears like a phantom

### Summary

**Repeatable Read** = “Data I read won’t change, but new rows may appear”

---

## 4️⃣ Serializable (Highest Isolation)

### Rule

Transactions execute **as if they are one after another**

### What It Prevents

* ✅ Dirty Read
* ✅ Non-repeatable Read
* ✅ Phantom Read

### Example

* T1 starts
* T2 tries to access same data
* T2 waits until T1 finishes
* T2 starts after T1 completes

✔ Fully safe
❌ Slowest

### Summary

**Serializable** = “One transaction at a time (perfect isolation)”

---

## 📊 Isolation Levels vs Problems (Final Table)

| Isolation Level  | Dirty Read | Non-Repeatable | Phantom |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------- |
| Read Uncommitted | ❌          | ❌              | ❌       |
| Read Committed   | ✅          | ❌              | ❌       |
| Repeatable Read  | ✅          | ✅              | ❌       |
| Serializable     | ✅          | ✅              | ✅       |

---

## 📝 Exam-Friendly One-Liners

* Read Uncommitted → allows dirty read
* Read Committed → prevents dirty read
* Repeatable Read → same row gives same result
* Serializable → behaves like serial execution

---

## 🎯 Final Intuition (Very Important)

Think of isolation levels like **classroom discipline**:

* Read Uncommitted → everyone talking
* Read Committed → listen when teacher finishes
* Repeatable Read → seat locked, no one touches your notes
* Serializable → only one student allowed at a time
