# ER Model in DBMS

A clear and well-designed **Entity–Relationship (ER) Model** is the foundation of a good database. It helps transform real-world requirements into a structured database design.

This README explains **all steps to draw an ER model** in **simple, exam‑friendly language**, with **examples**, **tables**, and **best practices**.

---

## What is an ER Model?

An **ER Model** is a conceptual diagram that represents:

* **Entities** (real-world objects)
* **Attributes** (properties of entities)
* **Relationships** (how entities are connected)

It is mainly used during **database design** before converting the model into relational tables.

---

## Steps to Draw an ER Model

Below are the **standard and complete steps** used in DBMS.

---

## Step 1: Recognize Entities

### What is an Entity?

An **entity** is a real-world object that can be uniquely identified.

### Examples

| Real-world Object | Entity Name |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Student           | STUDENT     |
| Teacher           | TEACHER     |
| Course            | COURSE      |
| Employee          | EMPLOYEE    |

### Tips

* Entity names are usually **singular nouns**
* Written in **uppercase** for clarity

---

## Step 2: Specify Entity Characteristics (Attributes)

### What are Attributes?

Attributes are **properties or details** that describe an entity.

### Example

**Entity: STUDENT**

| Attribute Name | Description          |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| Student_ID     | Unique ID of student |
| Name           | Student name         |
| Age            | Student age          |
| Email          | Email address        |
| Phone_No       | Contact number       |

### Attribute Types

| Type          | Example                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Simple        | Name                            |
| Composite     | Address (Street, City, Pincode) |
| Single-valued | Age                             |
| Multi-valued  | Phone Numbers                   |
| Derived       | Age (from DOB)                  |

---

## Step 3: Discover Relationships (and Constraints)

### What is a Relationship?

A **relationship** shows how two or more entities are connected.

### Example

* A **STUDENT enrolls in a COURSE**
* An **EMPLOYEE works in a DEPARTMENT**

### Relationship Constraints

| Constraint          | Meaning          |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Mapping Cardinality | 1:1, 1:N, M:N    |
| Participation       | Total or Partial |

---

## Step 4: Define Connection Type (Cardinality)

### What is Cardinality?

Cardinality defines **how many entities can participate** in a relationship.

### Types of Cardinality

| Cardinality | Meaning      | Example                |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| 1:1         | One to One   | Person ↔ Passport      |
| 1:N         | One to Many  | Department → Employees |
| M:N         | Many to Many | Students ↔ Courses     |

### Example

* One **DEPARTMENT** can have many **EMPLOYEES**
* One **EMPLOYEE** works in one **DEPARTMENT**

---

## Step 5: Construct the ER Diagram (ERD)

### ERD Symbols

| Component              | Symbol          |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Entity                 | Rectangle       |
| Attribute              | Oval            |
| Primary Key            | Underlined Oval |
| Relationship           | Diamond         |
| Multi-valued Attribute | Double Oval     |

### Simple ERD Example (Textual)

```
STUDENT ── enrolls ── COURSE
```

---

## Step 6: Annotate Relationships and Attributes

### Why Annotation is Important?

Annotations clearly specify:

* Cardinality
* Participation
* Relationship attributes

### Example

**Relationship: ENROLLS**

| Attribute       | Description        |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Enrollment_Date | Date of enrollment |
| Grade           | Grade obtained     |

---

## Step 7: Review and Refine the Model

### Checklist

* Are all entities required?
* Are attributes correct and minimal?
* Are relationships meaningful?
* Is redundancy avoided?

### Best Practice

Remove unnecessary attributes and merge duplicate entities.

---

## Step 8: Document the Model

### What to Document?

* Entity descriptions
* Attribute definitions
* Relationship meanings
* Business rules

### Example

```
STUDENT: Stores student academic information
COURSE: Stores course details
ENROLLS: Connects students with courses
```

---

## Step 9: Validate with Stakeholders

### Who are Stakeholders?

* Clients
* End users
* Business analysts

### Purpose

* Ensure business requirements are met
* Detect missing entities or rules

---

## Step 10: Implement the Database Schema

### Final Conversion

* Convert entities → tables
* Convert attributes → columns
* Convert relationships → foreign keys

### Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE STUDENT (
  Student_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(50),
  Age INT,
  Email VARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

## Summary Table

| Step | Description            |
| ---- | ---------------------- |
| 1    | Identify entities      |
| 2    | Define attributes      |
| 3    | Discover relationships |
| 4    | Set cardinality        |
| 5    | Draw ERD               |
| 6    | Annotate details       |
| 7    | Review model           |
| 8    | Document design        |
| 9    | Validate with users    |
| 10   | Implement schema       |
