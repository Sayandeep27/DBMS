# 📌 How to Find the Highest Normal Form in a Relation (DBMS)

A step-by-step, **exam-ready and interview-ready** guide to identify the **highest normal form (NF)** of any database relation.

## 📖 What is Normalization?

**Normalization** is the process of organizing data in a database to:

* Reduce **data redundancy**
* Avoid **update, insert, and delete anomalies**
* Improve **data integrity**

Databases are normalized using **Normal Forms (NF)**.

---

## 🧭 What Does “Highest Normal Form” Mean?

The **highest normal form** of a relation is:

> The **most advanced normal form** that the relation satisfies **without violating any rules**.

For example:

* If a table satisfies **1NF and 2NF**, but violates **3NF**, then its **highest normal form is 2NF**.

## 🪜 Normal Forms Overview

| Normal Form | Focus                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **1NF**     | Atomic values, no repeating groups |
| **2NF**     | No partial dependency              |
| **3NF**     | No transitive dependency           |
| **BCNF**    | Stronger version of 3NF            |

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Process to Find Highest Normal Form

Follow these steps **in order** — you cannot skip any.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Check First Normal Form (1NF)

### 📌 Rules of 1NF

* Each field must contain **atomic (indivisible) values**
* No **multi-valued attributes**
* No **repeating groups**

### ❌ Not in 1NF

| StudentID | Name  | Phone      |
| --------- | ----- | ---------- |
| 101       | Rahul | 9876, 9123 |

➡ Phone has multiple values → ❌ Not 1NF

### ✅ In 1NF

| StudentID | Name  | Phone |
| --------- | ----- | ----- |
| 101       | Rahul | 9876  |
| 101       | Rahul | 9123  |

✔ Atomic values → **1NF satisfied**

---

## ✅ Step 2: Identify Candidate Keys

A **candidate key** is a **minimal set of attributes** that uniquely identifies a tuple.

### Example

| StudentID | CourseID | Instructor |

Candidate Key → **(StudentID, CourseID)**

This step is **critical** for checking 2NF and 3NF.

---

## ✅ Step 3: Check Second Normal Form (2NF)

### 📌 Rules of 2NF

* Must be in **1NF**
* **No partial dependency**

### 📌 Partial Dependency

> When a **non-prime attribute** depends on **part of a composite key**

---

### ❌ Not in 2NF

| StudentID | CourseID | StudentName | CourseName |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------- |

Candidate Key → (StudentID, CourseID)

* StudentName → depends only on StudentID ❌
* CourseName → depends only on CourseID ❌

➡ Partial dependency exists → **Not in 2NF**

---

### ✅ In 2NF

Split into:

**Student Table**
| StudentID | StudentName |

**Course Table**
| CourseID | CourseName |

**Enrollment Table**
| StudentID | CourseID |

✔ No partial dependency → **2NF satisfied**

---

## ✅ Step 4: Check Third Normal Form (3NF)

### 📌 Rules of 3NF

* Must be in **2NF**
* **No transitive dependency**

### 📌 Transitive Dependency

> When a non-key attribute depends on **another non-key attribute**

---

### ❌ Not in 3NF

| EmpID | EmpName | DeptID | DeptName |

* EmpID → DeptID
* DeptID → DeptName

➡ EmpID → DeptName (indirect)

❌ Transitive dependency exists → Not in 3NF

---

### ✅ In 3NF

Split into:

**Employee Table**
| EmpID | EmpName | DeptID |

**Department Table**
| DeptID | DeptName |

✔ No transitive dependency → **3NF satisfied**

---

## ✅ Step 5: Check Boyce–Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

### 📌 Rules of BCNF

* Must be in **3NF**
* **Every determinant must be a candidate key**

---

### ❌ Not in BCNF

| Student | Subject | Professor |

Dependencies:

* Student, Subject → Professor
* Professor → Subject ❌

Professor is **not a candidate key** → ❌ Violates BCNF

✔ But satisfies 3NF

➡ **Highest Normal Form = 3NF**

---

### ✅ In BCNF

Split into:

| Professor | Subject |
| Student | Professor |

✔ All determinants are candidate keys → **BCNF satisfied**

---

## 🧮 Quick Decision Flow

```text
Start
 ↓
Is relation in 1NF?
 ↓ No → Highest NF = UNF
 ↓ Yes
Is relation in 2NF?
 ↓ No → Highest NF = 1NF
 ↓ Yes
Is relation in 3NF?
 ↓ No → Highest NF = 2NF
 ↓ Yes
Is relation in BCNF?
 ↓ No → Highest NF = 3NF
 ↓ Yes
Highest NF = BCNF
```

## 📊 Summary Table

| Normal Form | Key Check                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| **1NF**     | Atomic values               |
| **2NF**     | No partial dependency       |
| **3NF**     | No transitive dependency    |
| **BCNF**    | Determinant = Candidate key |

---

## 🎯 Exam Tips

* Always **start with 1NF**
* Clearly **write candidate keys**
* Mention **type of dependency violated**
* Final line must state:

  > **“Highest Normal Form of the given relation is ___.”**

---

## 📌 Final Takeaway

To find the **highest normal form**:

1. Check normal forms **sequentially**
2. Stop at the **first violation**
3. The **previous satisfied NF** is your answer
