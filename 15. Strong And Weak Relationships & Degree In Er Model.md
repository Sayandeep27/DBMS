# Strong and Weak Relationships & Degree in ER Model (ER Diagram)

A clean, beginner‑friendly, and **exam + interview ready** guide to understanding **Strong Relationships**, **Weak Relationships**, and **Degree in ER Model**, explained with **clear examples, tables, and diagrams (textual)**.

---

## 1. What is a Relationship in ER Model?

In an **Entity‑Relationship (ER) Model**, a **relationship** represents an **association between two or more entities**.

### Simple Example

* **Student** enrolls in **Course**

This association is called a **relationship**.

---

## 2. Strong Relationship

### Definition

A **strong relationship** exists **between two strong entities**, where:

* Both entities have **their own primary keys**
* Neither entity depends on the other for identification

### Key Characteristics

| Feature        | Description                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Entity Type    | Strong entities              |
| Primary Key    | Each entity has its own      |
| Dependency     | Independent                  |
| Participation  | Can be partial or total      |
| Representation | Single diamond in ER diagram |

---

### Example: Student – Course

#### Entities

**STUDENT**

| Student_ID (PK) | Name  | Dept |
| --------------- | ----- | ---- |
| 101             | Rahul | CSE  |
| 102             | Aditi | ECE  |

**COURSE**

| Course_ID (PK) | Course_Name | Credits |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| CS101          | DBMS        | 4       |
| CS102          | OS          | 3       |

#### Relationship: ENROLLS

* A student **enrolls in** a course
* Both entities exist independently

```
STUDENT ──── ENROLLS ──── COURSE
```

This is a **Strong Relationship** because:

* Student has Student_ID
* Course has Course_ID
* No entity depends on the other

---

## 3. Weak Relationship

### Definition

A **weak relationship** exists **between a strong entity and a weak entity**, where:

* Weak entity **does not have a primary key** of its own
* Weak entity **depends on strong entity for identification**

---

### Weak Entity

An entity that:

* Has **no primary key**
* Has a **partial key (discriminator)**
* Exists **only because of a strong entity**

---

### Key Characteristics

| Feature        | Description                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Entity Type    | Strong + Weak entity            |
| Primary Key    | Weak entity has none            |
| Dependency     | Weak entity depends on strong   |
| Participation  | Total participation (mandatory) |
| Representation | Double diamond in ER diagram    |

---

### Example: Employee – Dependent

#### Entities

**EMPLOYEE (Strong Entity)**

| Emp_ID (PK) | Name | Salary |
| ----------- | ---- | ------ |
| E101        | Amit | 50000  |
| E102        | Neha | 60000  |

**DEPENDENT (Weak Entity)**

| Dependent_Name (Partial Key) | Age | Relation |
| ---------------------------- | --- | -------- |
| Riya                         | 10  | Daughter |
| Ankit                        | 15  | Son      |

#### Relationship: HAS_DEPENDENT

```
EMPLOYEE ══ HAS_DEPENDENT ══ DEPENDENT
```

* Dependent **cannot exist without Employee**
* Dependent is identified by:

```
(Emp_ID + Dependent_Name)
```

This is a **Weak Relationship**.

## 4. Strong vs Weak Relationship (Comparison)

| Basis             | Strong Relationship     | Weak Relationship     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Entity Dependency | Independent             | Dependent             |
| Weak Entity       | Not involved            | Involved              |
| Primary Key       | Exists for all entities | Weak entity has no PK |
| Identification    | Self‑identified         | Owner‑identified      |
| ER Diagram        | Single diamond          | Double diamond        |

## 5. Degree of a Relationship

### Definition

The **degree of a relationship** is the **number of entity types participating** in that relationship.

---

## 6. Types of Relationship Degree

### 1. Unary Relationship (Degree = 1)

#### Definition

A relationship **within the same entity**.

#### Example: Employee supervises Employee

```
EMPLOYEE ── SUPERVISES ── EMPLOYEE
```

| Emp_ID | Name | Supervisor_ID |
| ------ | ---- | ------------- |
| 101    | A    | 105           |
| 105    | B    | NULL          |

---

### 2. Binary Relationship (Degree = 2)

#### Definition

A relationship between **two entities**.

#### Example: Student enrolls in Course

```
STUDENT ── ENROLLS ── COURSE
```

This is the **most common relationship**.

---

### 3. Ternary Relationship (Degree = 3)

#### Definition

A relationship involving **three entities simultaneously**.

#### Example: Teacher teaches Course in Classroom

```
TEACHER ── TEACHES ── COURSE
        \            /
          CLASSROOM
```

| Teacher | Course | Classroom |
| ------- | ------ | --------- |
| T1      | DBMS   | C101      |
| T2      | OS     | C102      |

---

### 4. N‑ary Relationship (Degree > 3)

#### Definition

A relationship involving **more than three entities**.

> Rarely used due to complexity

---

## 7. Degree Summary Table

| Degree | Name    | Example                         |
| ------ | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1      | Unary   | Employee supervises Employee    |
| 2      | Binary  | Student enrolls Course          |
| 3      | Ternary | Teacher teaches Course in Class |
| N      | N‑ary   | Complex business rules          |

---

## 8. Quick Exam Notes

* Strong relationship → between strong entities
* Weak relationship → involves weak entity
* Weak entity → no primary key
* Weak relationship → total participation
* Degree = number of entities involved

---

## 9. Final Takeaway

* **Strong vs Weak relationships** describe **dependency**
* **Degree** describes **how many entities are involved**
* Both are **core concepts** for DBMS exams, interviews, and system design

---

* ER diagrams with symbols
* Interview questions
* Practice problems
* Conversion to SQL schema
