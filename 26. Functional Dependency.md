# 📌 Functional Dependency in DBMS

A **Functional Dependency (FD)** is one of the most important concepts in **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**. It plays a critical role in **database design**, **normalization**, and **data integrity**.

This document explains **Functional Dependency**, **Trivial FD**, **Non-Trivial FD**, and **Completely Non-Trivial FD** in **simple language**, with **clear tables and examples**, in a **GitHub‑ready README format**.

---

## 🔹 What is Functional Dependency?

A **Functional Dependency** describes a **relationship between two sets of attributes** in a database table.

### ✅ Definition

> An attribute **B** is said to be *functionally dependent* on attribute **A** if **each value of A uniquely determines the value of B**.

### ✨ Notation

```
A → B
```

This means:

* If two rows have the **same value of A**, they must have the **same value of B**

---

## 🔹 Why Functional Dependency is Important?

Functional Dependency helps to:

* Identify **keys** in a table
* Remove **data redundancy**
* Avoid **update, insert, and delete anomalies**
* Perform **database normalization** (2NF, 3NF, BCNF)

---

## 🔹 Simple Example of Functional Dependency

### 📋 Student Table

| Student_ID | Student_Name | Department | Dept_Head  |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| 101        | Rahul        | CSE        | Dr. Sharma |
| 102        | Anjali       | ECE        | Dr. Mehta  |
| 103        | Aman         | CSE        | Dr. Sharma |

### 🔍 Observations

* `Student_ID → Student_Name`
* `Student_ID → Department`
* `Department → Dept_Head`

### ❌ What is NOT a Functional Dependency?

* `Student_Name → Student_ID` ❌ (names can repeat)

---

## 🔹 Types of Functional Dependency

Functional Dependency is mainly classified into:

1. **Trivial Functional Dependency**
2. **Non-Trivial Functional Dependency**
3. **Completely Non-Trivial Functional Dependency**

---

## 🔹 Trivial Functional Dependency

### ✅ Definition

A functional dependency **X → Y** is called **Trivial** if **Y is a subset of X**.

```
X → Y  (where Y ⊆ X)
```

### ✨ Why it is Trivial?

Because it is **always true** and **does not provide new information**.

---

### 📋 Example Table

| Roll_No | Name   | Course |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1       | Rahul  | CSE    |
| 2       | Anjali | ECE    |

### ✔ Examples of Trivial FD

```
(Roll_No, Name) → Roll_No
(Roll_No, Name) → Name
(Roll_No, Name) → (Roll_No, Name)
```

### 🔍 Explanation

* Right side attribute already exists on the left side
* Hence, dependency is **trivial**

---

## 🔹 Non‑Trivial Functional Dependency

### ✅ Definition

A functional dependency **X → Y** is **Non‑Trivial** if **Y is NOT a subset of X**.

```
X → Y  (where Y ⊄ X)
```

---

### 📋 Example Table

| Emp_ID | Emp_Name | Dept |
| ------ | -------- | ---- |
| E01    | Raj      | HR   |
| E02    | Simran   | IT   |
| E03    | Mohan    | HR   |

### ✔ Example

```
Emp_ID → Emp_Name
Emp_ID → Dept
```

### 🔍 Explanation

* `Emp_Name` and `Dept` are **not part of Emp_ID**
* So this dependency is **non‑trivial**

---

## 🔹 Completely Non‑Trivial Functional Dependency

### ✅ Definition

A functional dependency **X → Y** is **Completely Non‑Trivial** if:

```
X ∩ Y = Ø
```

This means:

* **No attribute on the right side appears on the left side**

---

### 📋 Example Table

| Student_ID | Course | Instructor  |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1          | DBMS   | Prof. Kumar |
| 2          | OS     | Prof. Singh |

### ✔ Example

```
Course → Instructor
```

### 🔍 Explanation

* `Course` and `Instructor` share **no common attributes**
* Hence, this is a **completely non‑trivial functional dependency**

---

## 🔹 Comparison Table

| Type                      | Condition | Example             |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| Trivial FD                | Y ⊆ X     | (A, B) → A          |
| Non‑Trivial FD            | Y ⊄ X     | A → B               |
| Completely Non‑Trivial FD | X ∩ Y = Ø | Course → Instructor |

---

## 🔹 Real‑Life Analogy

| Real World Scenario              | Functional Dependency |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Roll number identifies a student | Roll_No → Name        |
| Department decides HOD           | Department → HOD      |
| Vehicle number identifies owner  | Vehicle_No → Owner    |

---

## 🔹 Key Points to Remember

* Functional Dependency shows **attribute relationships**
* It is the **foundation of normalization**
* Trivial FD gives **no new information**
* Non‑Trivial FD helps in **design optimization**
* Completely Non‑Trivial FD has **no common attributes**

---

## ✅ Final Summary

Functional Dependency ensures:

* **Data consistency**
* **Minimal redundancy**
* **Efficient database design**

Understanding FD properly makes **normalization easy and logical**.
