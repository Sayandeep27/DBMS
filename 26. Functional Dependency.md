# 📌 Functional Dependency in DBMS

A **Functional Dependency (FD)** is one of the most important concepts in **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**. It plays a critical role in **database design**, **normalization**, and **data integrity**.

This document explains **Functional Dependency**, **Trivial FD**, **Non-Trivial FD**, and **Completely Non-Trivial FD** in **simple language**, with **clear tables and examples**, in a **GitHub‑ready README format**.

---

## 🔹 What is Functional Dependency?

A **Functional Dependency** describes a **relationship between two sets of attributes** in a database table.

### ✅ Definition

> An attribute **B** is said to be *functionally dependent* on attribute **A** if **each value of A uniquely determines the value of B**.

### ✨ Notation

```
A → B
```

This means:

* If two rows have the **same value of A**, they must have the **same value of B**

---

## 🔹 Why Functional Dependency is Important?

Functional Dependency helps to:

* Identify **keys** in a table
* Remove **data redundancy**
* Avoid **update, insert, and delete anomalies**
* Perform **database normalization** (2NF, 3NF, BCNF)

---

## 🔹 Simple Example of Functional Dependency

### 📋 Student Table

| Student_ID | Student_Name | Department | Dept_Head  |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| 101        | Rahul        | CSE        | Dr. Sharma |
| 102        | Anjali       | ECE        | Dr. Mehta  |
| 103        | Aman         | CSE        | Dr. Sharma |

### 🔍 Observations

* `Student_ID → Student_Name`
* `Student_ID → Department`
* `Department → Dept_Head`

### ❌ What is NOT a Functional Dependency?

* `Student_Name → Student_ID` ❌ (names can repeat)

---

## 🔹 Types of Functional Dependency

Functional Dependency is mainly classified into:

1. **Trivial Functional Dependency**
2. **Non-Trivial Functional Dependency**
3. **Completely Non-Trivial Functional Dependency**

---

## 🔹 Trivial Functional Dependency

### ✅ Definition

A functional dependency **X → Y** is called **Trivial** if **Y is a subset of X**.

```
X → Y   where Y ⊆ X
```

### 🧠 Meaning in Simple Words

The right-hand side attribute(s) are **already present** on the left-hand side. So, knowing X automatically means you already know Y.

---

### 📋 Example Table

| Roll_No | Name   | Course |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1       | Rahul  | CSE    |
| 2       | Anjali | ECE    |

### ✔ Examples of Trivial FD

```
(Roll_No, Name) → Roll_No
(Roll_No, Name) → Name
(Roll_No, Name) → (Roll_No, Name)
```

### 🔍 Explanation

* In all cases, the **right-hand side attribute already exists on the left-hand side**
* These dependencies **do not add any new information**
* Hence, they are called **Trivial Functional Dependencies**

---

## 🔹 Non‑Trivial Functional Dependency

### ✅ Definition

A functional dependency **X → Y** is **Non‑Trivial** if **Y is NOT a subset of X**.

```
X → Y   where Y ⊄ X
```

### 🧠 Meaning in Simple Words

At least **one attribute on the right-hand side is new**, i.e., it does not appear on the left-hand side.

---

### 📋 Example Table

| Emp_ID | Emp_Name | Dept |
| ------ | -------- | ---- |
| E01    | Raj      | HR   |
| E02    | Simran   | IT   |
| E03    | Mohan    | HR   |

### ✔ Examples of Non‑Trivial FD

```
Emp_ID → Emp_Name
Emp_ID → Dept
```

### 🔍 Explanation

* `Emp_Name` and `Dept` are **not part of Emp_ID**
* Knowing `Emp_ID` gives **new information**
* Hence, these are **Non‑Trivial Functional Dependencies**

---

### ⚠ Important Case (Very Common Confusion)

```
(A, B) → (B, C)
```

* `C` is new → so it is **Non‑Trivial** ✅
* But `B` appears on both sides → so it is **NOT completely non‑trivial** ❌

---

## 🔹 Completely Non‑Trivial Functional Dependency

### ✅ Definition

A functional dependency **X → Y** is **Completely Non‑Trivial** if **there is no common attribute between X and Y**.

```
X ∩ Y = Ø
```

### 🧠 Meaning in Simple Words

All attributes on the right-hand side are **completely new** and **none appear on the left-hand side**.

---

### 📋 Example Table

| Student_ID | Course | Instructor  |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1          | DBMS   | Prof. Kumar |
| 2          | OS     | Prof. Singh |

### ✔ Example

```
Course → Instructor
```

### 🔍 Explanation

* `Course` and `Instructor` share **no common attributes**
* The dependency provides **only new information**
* Hence, it is a **Completely Non‑Trivial Functional Dependency**

## 🔹 Comparison Table

| Type                      | Condition | Example             | Explanation                        |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Trivial FD                | Y ⊆ X     | (A, B) → A          | RHS already in LHS                 |
| Non-Trivial FD            | Y ⊄ X     | A → B               | At least one new attribute appears |
| Completely Non-Trivial FD | X ∩ Y = Ø | Course → Instructor | No overlap at all                  |

---

## 🔹 Clearing the Biggest Confusion: Non-Trivial vs Completely Non-Trivial

We **compare the LEFT side (X) and RIGHT side (Y)** of a functional dependency:

```
X → Y
```

### 🔑 The Only Question That Matters

👉 **Do X and Y share attributes or not?**

---

### 🧪 Master Relation Example

Assume a relation:

```
R(A, B, C)
```

We now test different functional dependencies on this relation.

---

### Case 1: Non-Trivial Functional Dependency

#### Rule

```
Y is NOT a subset of X
```

👉 Even if **one attribute in Y is new**, the FD is **Non-Trivial**.

---

#### Example 1

```
{A, B} → C
```

* X = {A, B}
* Y = {C}
* `C` is not in X

✔ **Non-Trivial**
✔ **Completely Non-Trivial**

---

#### Example 2 (VERY IMPORTANT)

```
{A, B} → {B, C}
```

* X = {A, B}
* Y = {B, C}

Is Y ⊆ X?

❌ No (because `C` is new)

✔ **Non-Trivial**

But wait…

---

### Case 2: Completely Non-Trivial Functional Dependency

#### Rule

```
X ∩ Y = Ø
```

👉 **No common attribute at all** between X and Y.

---

#### Re-check Example 2

```
{A, B} → {B, C}
```

* Common attribute = `B`

❌ **NOT Completely Non-Trivial**

👉 **This is the exact confusion point for most students.**

---

## 🔥 Final Difference (This Will Click)

**Non-Trivial FD**
RHS has **at least one new attribute**

**Completely Non-Trivial FD**
RHS has **only new attributes**

## 🔹 Side-by-Side Truth Table

| FD              | Non-Trivial? | Completely Non-Trivial? | Reason     |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| A → B           | ✅            | ✅                       | No overlap |
| {A, B} → C      | ✅            | ✅                       | No overlap |
| {A, B} → {B, C} | ✅            | ❌                       | B overlaps |
| {A, B} → B      | ❌            | ❌                       | Trivial    |
| {A, B} → {A, B} | ❌            | ❌                       | Trivial    |

---

## 🧠 One-Line Killer Memory Trick

* **Non-Trivial** → *Something new appears on RHS*
* **Completely Non-Trivial** → *ONLY new things appear on RHS*

---

## 👁 Ultra-Simple Visual

```
Non-Trivial:
X → (some old + some new)  ✅

Completely Non-Trivial:
X → (only new)            ✅
```

## 📝 Final Exam-Ready Statement

> A functional dependency is **non-trivial** if the right-hand side contains **at least one attribute not present** in the left-hand side.
> It is **completely non-trivial** if the left-hand side and right-hand side have **no common attributes**.

------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Trivial FD                | Y ⊆ X           | (A, B) → A             | RHS already in LHS                  |
| Non‑Trivial FD            | Y ⊄ X           | A → B                  | At least one new attribute appears  |
| Completely Non‑Trivial FD | X ∩ Y = Ø       | Course → Instructor    | No overlap at all                   |

---

## 🔹 Real‑Life Analogy

| Real World Scenario              | Functional Dependency |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Roll number identifies a student | Roll_No → Name        |
| Department decides HOD           | Department → HOD      |
| Vehicle number identifies owner  | Vehicle_No → Owner    |

---

## 🔹 Key Points to Remember

* Functional Dependency shows **attribute relationships**
* It is the **foundation of normalization**
* Trivial FD gives **no new information**
* Non‑Trivial FD introduces **at least one new attribute**
* Completely Non‑Trivial FD introduces **only new attributes**

---

## ✅ Final Summary

* **Trivial FD** → Nothing new on RHS
* **Non‑Trivial FD** → Something new on RHS
* **Completely Non‑Trivial FD** → Only new things on RHS

Understanding these three clearly removes **90% of confusion in DBMS normalization problems**.
