# 📘 Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

A **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** is the most widely used type of database system in the world. It stores data in a **structured, organized, and reliable** way using **tables** and maintains relationships between them.

This README explains **RDBMS from scratch** in **simple language**, with **clear tables, examples, and SQL snippets**, making it perfect for **students, interviews, and GitHub projects**.

---

## 📌 What is RDBMS?

An **RDBMS** is a database management system where:

* Data is stored in **tables (relations)**
* Each table has **rows and columns**
* Tables are **linked using keys**
* Data follows strict **rules (constraints)** to maintain accuracy

> 💡 Think of RDBMS like an **Excel system**, but much more powerful, secure, and scalable.

## 📊 How Data is Stored in RDBMS

### Example: `STUDENT` Table

| Student_ID | Name  | Age | Course |
| ---------: | ----- | --- | ------ |
|        101 | Rahul | 20  | B.Tech |
|        102 | Aditi | 21  | BCA    |
|        103 | Aman  | 22  | MCA    |

* **Row (Tuple)** → One complete record (e.g., Rahul’s data)
* **Column (Attribute)** → One type of data (e.g., Age)
* **Table (Relation)** → Collection of related data

---

## 🔑 Keys in RDBMS (Foundation of Relationships)

Keys uniquely identify records and create links between tables.

### 1️⃣ Primary Key

* Uniquely identifies each row
* Cannot be NULL or duplicate

```sql
Student_ID INT PRIMARY KEY
```

### 2️⃣ Foreign Key

* Creates a relationship between two tables

```sql
Student_ID INT REFERENCES STUDENT(Student_ID)
```

### Example: Two Related Tables

#### STUDENT Table

| Student_ID | Name  |
| ---------: | ----- |
|        101 | Rahul |
|        102 | Aditi |

#### MARKS Table

| Mark_ID | Student_ID | Marks |
| ------: | ---------: | ----: |
|       1 |        101 |    85 |
|       2 |        102 |    90 |

➡️ `Student_ID` links both tables

## 🔗 Relationships in RDBMS

| Relationship Type | Description               | Example           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| One-to-One        | One record linked to one  | Person → Passport |
| One-to-Many       | One record linked to many | Student → Marks   |
| Many-to-Many      | Many linked to many       | Student ↔ Course  |

---

## 📐 Constraints in RDBMS

Constraints ensure **data accuracy and integrity**.

| Constraint  | Purpose                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| PRIMARY KEY | Unique identification    |
| FOREIGN KEY | Relationship enforcement |
| NOT NULL    | Prevents empty values    |
| UNIQUE      | No duplicates            |
| CHECK       | Validates conditions     |
| DEFAULT     | Sets default value       |

### Example

```sql
Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18)
```

---

## 🧠 SQL – Language of RDBMS

SQL (**Structured Query Language**) is used to interact with RDBMS.

### Common SQL Commands

| Category | Commands               |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| DDL      | CREATE, ALTER, DROP    |
| DML      | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE |
| DQL      | SELECT                 |
| DCL      | GRANT, REVOKE          |
| TCL      | COMMIT, ROLLBACK       |

### Example Queries

```sql
SELECT * FROM STUDENT;
```

```sql
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES (104, 'Neha', 21, 'MBA');
```

---

## 🔐 Data Integrity in RDBMS

RDBMS ensures:

* **Entity Integrity** – No NULL primary keys
* **Referential Integrity** – Valid foreign keys
* **Domain Integrity** – Correct data type & range

---

## 🧩 Normalization in RDBMS

Normalization organizes data to:

* Reduce redundancy
* Avoid anomalies

### Example (Unnormalized)

| Student | Course | Fees |
| ------- | ------ | ---- |
| Rahul   | B.Tech | 80k  |
| Rahul   | MBA    | 90k  |

### Normalized

**STUDENT Table**
| Student_ID | Name |

**COURSE Table**
| Course_ID | Course | Fees |

## ⚙️ Popular RDBMS Software

| RDBMS      | Used By             |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| MySQL      | Web Apps            |
| PostgreSQL | Enterprise Systems  |
| Oracle     | Banking, ERP        |
| SQL Server | Microsoft Ecosystem |
| SQLite     | Mobile Apps         |

## 🆚 RDBMS vs DBMS

| Feature        | DBMS  | RDBMS  |
| -------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Data Structure | Files | Tables |
| Relationships  | No    | Yes    |
| Normalization  | No    | Yes    |
