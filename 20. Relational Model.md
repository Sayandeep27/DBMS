# Relational Model in DBMS

---

## 📌 What is the Relational Model?

The **Relational Model** is a way of organizing data in the form of **tables** (also called **relations**).
Each table consists of **rows** and **columns**, where:

* **Rows** represent individual records
* **Columns** represent attributes (properties)

This model was proposed by **E. F. Codd** and is the foundation of most modern databases like **MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server**, etc.

## 📊 Basic Structure of a Relation (Table)

| Roll_No | Name   | Age | Course |
| ------- | ------ | --- | ------ |
| 101     | Rahul  | 20  | B.Tech |
| 102     | Ananya | 21  | B.Sc   |
| 103     | Aman   | 22  | BCA    |

* Table Name: **STUDENT**
* Each row = one student
* Each column = one property of a student

## 📘 Important Terms in Relational Model

### 1️⃣ Table (Relation)

A **table** is a collection of related data stored in rows and columns.

**Example:** STUDENT table

---

### 2️⃣ Row (Tuple)

A **row** represents a single record in a table.

**Example:**

```
(101, Rahul, 20, B.Tech)
```

This row represents one student.

---

### 3️⃣ Column (Attribute)

A **column** represents a property or characteristic of an entity.

**Examples:** Roll_No, Name, Age, Course

---

### 4️⃣ Record

A **record** means one complete row in a table.

✔ Every **tuple is a record**
✔ Every **record represents one real-world entity**

---

### 5️⃣ Domain

A **domain** defines the **type of values** an attribute can store.

| Attribute | Domain Example     |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| Roll_No   | Integer (positive) |
| Name      | String (text)      |
| Age       | Integer (0–100)    |
| Course    | String             |

---

### 6️⃣ Degree

The **degree** of a relation is the **number of columns** in a table.

**Example:**

* STUDENT table has 4 columns

```
Degree = 4
```

---

### 7️⃣ Cardinality

The **cardinality** of a relation is the **number of rows (tuples)** in a table.

**Example:**

* STUDENT table has 3 rows

```
Cardinality = 3
```

---

## 🧩 Relation Schema

A **relation schema** describes the structure of a table.

**Syntax:**

```
Relation_Name(Attribute1, Attribute2, Attribute3, ...)
```

**Example:**

```
STUDENT(Roll_No, Name, Age, Course)
```

## 🔑 Keys in Relational Model (Overview)

| Key Type      | Meaning                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Key   | Uniquely identifies a row                           |
| Candidate Key | Possible primary keys                               |
| Foreign Key   | Refers to primary key of another table              |
| Composite Key | Key made of multiple attributes                     |
| Super Key     | Any set of attributes that uniquely identifies rows |

## 🔗 Example with Two Related Tables

### STUDENT Table

| Roll_No | Name   | Course_ID |
| ------- | ------ | --------- |
| 101     | Rahul  | C01       |
| 102     | Ananya | C02       |

### COURSE Table

| Course_ID | Course_Name |
| --------- | ----------- |
| C01       | B.Tech      |
| C02       | B.Sc        |

✔ **Course_ID** in STUDENT is a **Foreign Key**
✔ It links STUDENT and COURSE tables

## ✅ Advantages of Relational Model

* Simple and easy to understand
* Data is stored in structured form
* Supports powerful SQL queries
* Ensures data integrity using constraints
* Easy to maintain and modify

---

## ❌ Limitations of Relational Model

* Not ideal for very complex data (like graphs)
* Performance issues with very large joins
* Less flexible for unstructured data

---

## 🧠 Real-Life Example

Think of a **college register**:

* Each page = Table
* Each student entry = Row
* Each column = Attribute

That is exactly how the **Relational Model** works.

---

## 📌 Summary

* Relational Model stores data in **tables**
* Rows = **Tuples**, Columns = **Attributes**
* Degree = number of columns
* Cardinality = number of rows
* Domains restrict valid values
* Keys help uniquely identify data
