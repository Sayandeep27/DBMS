## 📌 What are ACID Properties?

**ACID** is a set of **four fundamental properties** that guarantee **reliable and safe transaction processing** in a database.

When multiple users access a database **at the same time**, ACID ensures:

* Data remains **correct**
* Data remains **consistent**
* Failures do **not corrupt** the database

### 🔤 ACID stands for:

| Letter | Property    | Purpose                      |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| A      | Atomicity   | All or nothing execution     |
| C      | Consistency | Valid state before & after   |
| I      | Isolation   | Transactions don’t interfere |
| D      | Durability  | Changes are permanent        |

---

## 🔁 What is a Transaction?

A **transaction** is a **sequence of database operations** performed as a **single logical unit of work**.

### Example Transaction (Bank Transfer)

```
Transfer ₹1000 from Account A to Account B
```

Steps:

1. Deduct ₹1000 from A
2. Add ₹1000 to B

Both steps together form **one transaction**.

---

## 🧨 1. Atomicity

### 📖 Definition

**Atomicity** ensures that:

> A transaction is treated as a **single, indivisible unit** — either **all operations succeed** or **none happen**.

There is **no partial execution**.

---

### 🏦 Real‑Life Example (ATM Withdrawal)

You withdraw ₹500:

Steps:

1. Deduct ₹500 from account
2. Dispense cash

| Scenario           | Result                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Both steps succeed | Transaction commits ✅   |
| Cash not dispensed | Deduction rolled back ❌ |

👉 You should **never lose money without getting cash**.

---

### 💻 SQL Example

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Account
SET balance = balance - 500
WHERE acc_no = 101;

UPDATE ATM
SET cash = cash - 500
WHERE atm_id = 5;

COMMIT;
```

If **any error occurs**, DBMS executes:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

---

### ❌ Without Atomicity

* Money deducted
* Cash not received
* Data becomes unreliable

---

## ✅ 2. Consistency

### 📖 Definition

**Consistency** ensures that:

> A transaction takes the database from **one valid state to another valid state**.

All **constraints and rules** must be followed.

---

### 📚 Types of Constraints

* Primary Key
* Foreign Key
* NOT NULL
* CHECK
* UNIQUE

---

### 🏦 Example (Bank Rules)

Rule:

```
Account balance cannot be negative
```

Transaction:

```sql
UPDATE Account
SET balance = balance - 5000
WHERE acc_no = 101;
```

| Condition      | Result     |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Balance ≥ 5000 | Allowed ✅  |
| Balance < 5000 | Rejected ❌ |

---

### ❌ Without Consistency

* Negative balances
* Invalid foreign keys
* Broken business rules

---

## 🔒 3. Isolation

### 📖 Definition

**Isolation** ensures that:

> Multiple transactions execute **independently**, as if they were running **one by one**.

Intermediate states are **not visible** to other transactions.

---

### 👥 Example (Two Users Booking Last Seat)

| Time | Transaction T1 | Transaction T2 |
| ---- | -------------- | -------------- |
| t1   | Reads seat = 1 | Reads seat = 1 |
| t2   | Books seat     | —              |
| t3   | —              | Books seat ❌   |

❗ Without isolation → **double booking**

---

### 🔐 With Isolation

* One transaction locks the data
* Other waits until commit/rollback

---

### ⚙️ Isolation Levels

| Level            | Problem Allowed     |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Read Uncommitted | Dirty Read          |
| Read Committed   | Non‑Repeatable Read |
| Repeatable Read  | Phantom Read        |
| Serializable     | None (Best)         |

---

### 💻 SQL Example

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

---

## 💾 4. Durability

### 📖 Definition

**Durability** ensures that:

> Once a transaction is **committed**, its changes **will never be lost**, even if the system crashes.

---

### 💥 Example (Power Failure)

Transaction:

```sql
COMMIT;
```

Immediately after commit:

* Power fails ⚡
* System restarts 🔄

✅ Data is **still saved** in the database.

---

### 🧰 How Durability is Achieved

* Write‑Ahead Logging (WAL)
* Disk storage
* Backups
* Replication

---

### ❌ Without Durability

* Committed data disappears
* Financial loss
* Trust issues

## 🧠 ACID Properties — Quick Summary

| Property    | Guarantees                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Atomicity   | All or nothing execution    |
| Consistency | Valid database state        |
| Isolation   | No transaction interference |
| Durability  | Permanent data              |

---

## 🎯 Why ACID is Important

ACID properties ensure:

* 💰 Safe financial transactions
* 🏦 Reliable banking systems
* 🛒 Correct e‑commerce orders
* 🏥 Accurate medical records

Without ACID:

> A DBMS cannot be trusted.

---

## 📌 Exam‑Friendly One‑Line Definitions

* **Atomicity**: Transaction executes fully or not at all
* **Consistency**: Database rules are never violated
* **Isolation**: Transactions behave as if executed serially
* **Durability**: Committed data survives failures
