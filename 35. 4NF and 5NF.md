# 📘 Fourth Normal Form (4NF) and Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

A **complete, beginner‑friendly, and exam‑oriented guide** to **4NF and 5NF in DBMS**, explained in **simple language** with **clear tables, real examples, and step‑by‑step logic**.

This README is **GitHub‑ready** and suitable for **college exams, interviews, and quick revision**.

---

## 🔁 Where Do 4NF and 5NF Fit?

Before jumping in, let’s place them correctly:

```
1NF → 2NF → 3NF → BCNF → 4NF → 5NF
```

* **BCNF** handles problems caused by **functional dependencies**
* **4NF** handles problems caused by **multivalued dependencies**
* **5NF** handles problems caused by **join dependencies**

---

# 🔷 FOURTH NORMAL FORM (4NF)

## 📌 What is 4NF?

A relation is in **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)** if:

> ✅ It is already in **BCNF**
>
> ✅ It has **NO non‑trivial multivalued dependencies**

---

## ❓ What is a Multivalued Dependency (MVD)?

A **multivalued dependency** happens when:

* One attribute determines **multiple independent values** of another attribute
* These values are **independent of other attributes**

### Notation

```
A ↠ B
```

(Read as: A multidetermines B)

---

## 🎓 Easy Real‑Life Example

### Scenario

A **student** can have:

* Multiple **skills**
* Multiple **hobbies**

Skills and hobbies are **independent** of each other.

---

## ❌ Table NOT in 4NF

### Student_Info

| Student | Skill  | Hobby    |
| ------- | ------ | -------- |
| Alice   | Python | Painting |
| Alice   | Python | Singing  |
| Alice   | Java   | Painting |
| Alice   | Java   | Singing  |

### ❗ Problem

* Student ↠ Skill
* Student ↠ Hobby

This causes:

* **Redundancy**
* **Insertion anomalies**
* **Deletion anomalies**

So this table **violates 4NF**.

---

## ✅ Convert to 4NF (Decomposition)

### Table 1: Student_Skill

| Student | Skill  |
| ------- | ------ |
| Alice   | Python |
| Alice   | Java   |

### Table 2: Student_Hobby

| Student | Hobby    |
| ------- | -------- |
| Alice   | Painting |
| Alice   | Singing  |

### 🎉 Result

* No multivalued dependency
* No redundancy
* Table is now in **4NF**

---

## 🧠 Key Points for 4NF

* Deals with **multivalued dependencies**
* Requires **BCNF** first
* One fact = one table
* Very important for **theory questions**

---

# 🔷 FIFTH NORMAL FORM (5NF)

## 📌 What is 5NF?

A relation is in **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)** if:

> ✅ It is already in **4NF**
>
> ✅ It cannot be decomposed further **without losing information**
>
> ✅ Every join dependency is implied by candidate keys

---

## ❓ What is a Join Dependency?

A **join dependency** exists when:

* A table can be split into **multiple smaller tables**
* And **only by joining all of them**, we get the original table

If decomposition is possible **without loss**, then original table was **not in 5NF**.

---

## 🎓 Easy Example for 5NF

### Scenario

A company tracks:

* **Supplier**
* **Part**
* **Project**

Rules:

* A supplier supplies certain parts
* A part is used in certain projects
* A supplier works on certain projects

---

## ❌ Table NOT in 5NF

### Supply

| Supplier | Part | Project |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| S1       | P1   | J1      |
| S1       | P2   | J1      |
| S2       | P1   | J2      |

### ❗ Problem

This table has **join dependency**:

```
(Supplier, Part), (Supplier, Project), (Part, Project)
```

So it is **NOT in 5NF**.

---

## ✅ Convert to 5NF

### Table 1: Supplier_Part

| Supplier | Part |
| -------- | ---- |
| S1       | P1   |
| S1       | P2   |
| S2       | P1   |

### Table 2: Supplier_Project

| Supplier | Project |
| -------- | ------- |
| S1       | J1      |
| S2       | J2      |

### Table 3: Part_Project

| Part | Project |
| ---- | ------- |
| P1   | J1      |
| P2   | J1      |
| P1   | J2      |

### 🎉 Result

* Only valid joins recreate original data
* No redundancy
* Table is now in **5NF**

---

## 🧠 Key Points for 5NF

* Also called **Project‑Join Normal Form (PJNF)**
* Handles **join dependency anomalies**
* Rare in real systems
* Important for **theory + advanced DBMS exams**

# 🆚 4NF vs 5NF (Quick Comparison)

| Feature          | 4NF                    | 5NF             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Focus            | Multivalued dependency | Join dependency |
| Based on         | BCNF                   | 4NF             |
| Complexity       | Medium                 | High            |
| Used in practice | Sometimes              | Rare            |
| Exam importance  | ⭐⭐⭐⭐                   | ⭐⭐⭐             |

---

## ✅ Final Exam Tip

> If **one attribute independently decides multiple values** → think **4NF**
>
> If **data correctness depends on joining many tables** → think **5NF**
